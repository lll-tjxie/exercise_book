THE CALL OF SPRING\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, after all, the country isn\\'t such a bad place as some city folk\\r\\nthink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young fellow who said this stood upon the highest point of the Ridge\\r\\nRoad, where the land sloped abruptly to the valley in which lay the\\r\\nsmall municipality of Crawberry on the one hand, while on the other open\\r\\nfields and patches of woodland, in a huge green-and-brown checkerboard\\r\\npattern, fell more easily to the bank of the distant river.\\r\\n\\r\\nDotted here and there about the farming country lying before the youth\\r\\nas he looked westward were cottages, or the more important-looking\\r\\nhomesteads on the larger farms; and in the distance a white church spire\\r\\nbehind the trees marked the tiny settlement of Blaine\\'s Smithy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Sabbath calm lay over the fields and woods. It was mid-afternoon of\\r\\nan early February Sunday--the time of the mid-winter thaw, that false\\r\\nprophet of the real springtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough not a furrow had been turned as yet in the fields, and the snow\\r\\nlay deep in some fence corners and beneath the hedges, there was, after\\r\\nall, a smell of fresh earth--a clean, live smell--that Hiram Strong had\\r\\nmissed all week down in Crawberry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad I came up here,\" he muttered, drawing in great breaths of\\r\\nthe clean air. \"Just to look at the open fields, without any brick and\\r\\nmortar around, makes a fellow feel fine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stretched his arms above his head and, standing alone there on the\\r\\nupland, felt bigger and better than he had in weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Hiram Strong was a country boy, born and bred, and the town stifled\\r\\nhim. Besides, he had begun to see that his two years in Crawberry had\\r\\nbeen wasted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As a hustler after fortune in the city I am not a howling success,\"\\r\\nmused Hiram. \"Somehow, I\\'m cramped down yonder,\" and he glanced back\\r\\nat the squalid brick houses below him, the smoky roofs, and the ugly\\r\\nfactory chimneys.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I declare,\" he pursued, reflectively, \"I don\\'t believe I can stand\\r\\nOld Dan Dwight much longer. Dan, Junior, is bad enough--when he is\\r\\naround the store; but the boss would drive a fellow to death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head, now turning from the pleasanter prospect of the\\r\\nfarming land and staring down into the town.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maybe I\\'m not a success because I don\\'t stick to one thing. I\\'ve had\\r\\nsix jobs in less\\'n two years. That\\'s a bad record for a boy, I believe.\\r\\nBut there hasn\\'t any of them suited me, nor have I suited them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Dwight\\'s Emporium beats \\'em all!\" finished Hiram, shaking his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned his back upon the town once more, as though to wipe his\\r\\nfailure out of his memory. Before him sloped a field of wheat and\\r\\nclover.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had kept as green under the snow as though winter was an unknown\\r\\nseason. Every cloverleaf sparkled and the leaves of wheat bristled like\\r\\ntiny spears.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpring was on the way. He could hear the call of it!\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years before Hiram had left the farm. He had no immediate relatives\\r\\nafter his father died. The latter had been a tenant-farmer only, and\\r\\nwhen his tools and stock and the few household chattels had been sold\\r\\nto pay the debts that had accumulated during his last illness, there was\\r\\nvery little money left for Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nobody to say him nay when he packed his bag and started for\\r\\nCrawberry, which was the metropolis of his part of the country. He had\\r\\nset out boldly, believing that he could get ahead faster, and become\\r\\nmaster of his own fortune more quickly in town than in the locality\\r\\nwhere he was born.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a rugged, well-set-up youth of seventeen, not over-tall, but\\r\\nsturdy and able to do a man\\'s work. Indeed, he had long done a man\\'s\\r\\nwork before he left the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram\\'s hands were calloused, he shuffled a bit when walked, and his\\r\\nshoulders were just a little bowed from holding the plow handles since\\r\\nhe had been big enough to bridle his father\\'s old mare.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, the work on the farm had been hard--especially for a growing boy.\\r\\nMany farm boys work under better conditions than Hiram had.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, after a two years\\' trial of what the city has in store for\\r\\nmost country boys who cut loose from their old environment, Hiram Strong\\r\\nfelt to-day as though he must get back to the land.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s nothing for me in town. Clerking in Dwight\\'s Emporium will\\r\\nnever get me anywhere,\" he thought, turning finally away from the open\\r\\ncountry and starting down the steep hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, there are college boys working on our street cars here--waiting\\r\\nfor some better job to turn up. What chance does a fellow stand who\\'s\\r\\nonly got a country school education?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And there isn\\'t any clean fun for a fellow in Crawberry--fun that\\r\\ndoesn\\'t cost money. And goodness knows I can\\'t make more than enough to\\r\\npay Mrs. Atterson, and for my laundry, and buy a new suit of overalls\\r\\nand a pair of shoes occasionally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir!\" concluded Hiram. \"There\\'s nothing in it. Not for a fellow\\r\\nlike me, at any rate. I\\'d better be back on the farm--and I wish I was\\r\\nthere now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been to church that morning; but after the late dinner at his\\r\\nboarding house had set out on this lonely walk. Now he had nothing to\\r\\nlook forward to as he returned but the stuffy parlor of Mrs. Atterson\\'s\\r\\nboarding house, the cold supper in the dining-room, which was attended\\r\\nin a desultory fashion by such of the boarders as were at home, and then\\r\\na long, dull evening in his room, or bed after attending the evening\\r\\nservice at the church around the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram even shrank from meeting the same faces at the boarding house\\r\\ntable, hearing the same stale jokes or caustic remarks about Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson\\'s food from Fred Crackit and the young men boarders of his\\r\\nclass, or the grumbling of Mr. Peebles, the dyspeptic invalid, or the\\r\\ninane monologue of Old Lem Camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Mrs. Atterson herself--good soul though she was--had gotten on Hiram\\r\\nStrong\\'s nerves, too. With her heat-blistered face, near-sighted eyes\\r\\npeering through beclouded spectacles, and her gown buttoned up hurriedly\\r\\nand with a gap here and there where a button was missing, she was the\\r\\ntypically frowsy, hurried, nagged-to-death boarding house mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as for \"Sister,\" Mrs. Atterson\\'s little slavey and\\r\\nmaid-of-all-work----\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Sister\\'s the limit!\" smiled Hiram, as he turned into the street,\\r\\nwith its rows of ugly brick houses on either hand. \"I believe Fred\\r\\nCrackit has got it right. Mrs. Atterson keeps Sister instead of a\\r\\ncat--so there\\'ll be something to kick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe half-grown girl--narrow-chested, round shouldered, and sallow--had\\r\\nbeen taken by Mrs. Atterson from some charity institution. \"Sister,\" as\\r\\nthe boarders all called her, for lack of any other cognomen, would have\\r\\nher yellow hair in four attenuated pigtails hanging down her back, and\\r\\nshe would shuffle about the dining-room in a pair of Mrs. Atterson\\'s old\\r\\nshoes----\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jove! there she is now,\" exclaimed the startled youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the corner of the street several \"slices\" of the brick block had\\r\\nbeen torn away and the lot cleared for the erection of some business\\r\\nbuilding. Running across this open space with wild shrieks and spilling\\r\\nthe milk from the big pitcher she carried--milk for the boarders\\' tea,\\r\\nHi knew--came Mrs. Atterson\\'s maid.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind her, and driving her like a horse by the ever present \"pigtails,\"\\r\\nbounded a boy of about her own age--a laughing, yelling imp of a boy\\r\\nwhom Hiram knew very well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That Dan Dwight is the meanest little scamp at this end of the town!\"\\r\\nhe said to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise the two made attracted only the idle curiosity of a few\\r\\npeople. It was a locality where, even on Sundays, there was more or less\\r\\nnoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister begged and screamed. She feared she would spill the milk and told\\r\\nDan, Junior, so. But he only drove her the harder, yelling to her to\\r\\n\"Get up!\" and yanking as hard as he could on the braids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here! that\\'s enough of that!\" called Hiram, stepping quickly toward the\\r\\ntwo.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Sister had stopped exhausted, and in tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be off with you!\" commanded Hiram. \"You\\'ve plagued the girl enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mind your business, Hi-ram-Lo-ram!\" returned Dan, Junior, grabbing at\\r\\nSister\\'s hair again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram caught the younger boy by the shoulder and whirled him around.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You run along to Mrs. Atterson, Sister,\" he said, quietly. \"No, you\\r\\ndon\\'t!\" he added, gripping Dan, Junior, more firmly. \"You\\'ll stop right\\r\\nhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lemme be, Hi Strong!\" bawled the other, when he found he could not\\r\\neasily jerk away. \"It\\'ll be the worse for you if you don\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just you wait until the girl is home,\" returned Hiram, laughing. It was\\r\\nan easy matter for him to hold the writhing Dan, Junior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll fix you for this!\" squalled the boy. \"Wait till I tell my father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You wouldn\\'t dare tell your father the truth,\" laughed Hi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll fix you,\" repeated Dan, Junior, and suddenly aimed a vicious kick\\r\\nat his captor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the kick landed where Dan, Junior, intended--under Hi\\'s kneecap--the\\r\\nlatter certainly would have been \"fixed.\" But the country youth was too\\r\\nagile for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe jumped aside, dragged Dan, Junior, suddenly toward him, and then gave\\r\\nhim a backward thrust which sent the lighter boy spinning.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it had rained the day before and in a hollow beside the path was\\r\\na puddle several inches deep. Dan, Junior, lost his balance, staggered\\r\\nback, tripped over his own clumsy heels, and splashed full length into\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, oh!\" he bawled, managing to get well soaked before he scrambled\\r\\nout. \"I\\'ll tell my father on you, Hi Strong. You\\'ll catch it for this!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'d better run home before you catch cold,\" said Hiram, who could not\\r\\nhelp laughing at the young rascal\\'s plight. \"And let girls alone another\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo himself he said: \"Well, the goodness knows I couldn\\'t be much more\\r\\nin bad odor with Mr. Dwight than I am already. But this escapade of his\\r\\nprecious son ought to about \\'fix\\' me, as Dan, Junior, says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whether I want to, or not, I reckon I will be looking for another job\\r\\nin a very few days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II. AT MRS. ATTERSON\\'S\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you came into \"Mother\" Atterson\\'s front hall (the young men\\r\\nboarders gave her that appellation in irony) the ghosts of many ancient\\r\\nboiled dinners met you with--if you were sensitive and unused to the\\r\\nodors of cheap boarding houses--a certain shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was starting up the stairs, on which the ragged carpet threatened to\\r\\nsend less agile persons than Mrs. Atterson\\'s boarders headlong to\\r\\nthe bottom at every downward trip, when the clang of the gong in the\\r\\ndining-room announced the usual cold spread which the landlady thought\\r\\ndue to her household on the first day of the week.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram hesitated, decided that he would skip the meal, and started up\\r\\nagain. But just then Fred Crackit lounged out of the parlor, with Mr.\\r\\nPeebles following him. Dyspeptic as he was, Mr. Peebles never missed a\\r\\nmeal himself, and Crackit said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on, Hi-Low-Jack! Aren\\'t you coming down to the usual feast of\\r\\nreason and flow of soul?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCrackit thought he was a natural humorist, and he had to keep up his\\r\\nreputation at all times and seasons. He was rather a dissipated-looking\\r\\nman of thirty years or so, given to gay waistcoats and wonderfully knit\\r\\nties. A brilliant as large as a hazel-nut--and which, in some lights,\\r\\nreally sparkled like a diamond--adorned the tie he wore this evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe I want any supper,\" responded Hiram, pleasantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter? Got some inside information as to what Mother\\r\\nAtterson has laid out for us? You\\'re pretty thick with the old girl,\\r\\nHi.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not a nice way to speak of her, Mr. Crackit,\" said Hi, in a low\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other boarders--those who were in the house-straggled into the\\r\\nbasement dining-room one after the other, and took their places at the\\r\\nlong table, each in his customary manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat dining-room at Mother Atterson\\'s never could have been a cheerful\\r\\nplace. It was long, and low-ceiled, and the paper on the walls was\\r\\na dingy red, so old that the figure on it had retired into the\\r\\nbackground--been absorbed by it, so to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two long, dusty, windows looked upon an area, and were grilled half\\r\\nway up by wrought-iron screens which, too, helped to shut out the light\\r\\nof day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long table was covered by a red figured table cloth. The \"castors\"\\r\\nat both ends and in the middle were the ugliest--Hiram was sure--to be\\r\\nfound in all the city of Crawberry. The crockery was of the coarsest\\r\\nkind. The knives and forks were antediluvian. The napkins were as coarse\\r\\nas huck towels.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs. Atterson\\'s food--considering the cost of provisions and the\\r\\ncharge she made for her table--was very good. Only it had become a habit\\r\\nfor certain of the boarders, led by the jester, Crackit, to criticise\\r\\nthe viands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes they succeeded in making Mrs. Atterson angry; and sometimes,\\r\\nHiram knew, she wept, alone in the dining-room, after the harumscarum,\\r\\nthoughtless crowd had gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Lem Camp--nobody save Hiram thought to put \"Mr.\" before the old\\r\\ngentleman\\'s name--sidled in and sat down beside the country boy, as\\r\\nusual. He was a queer, colorless sort of person--a man who never looked\\r\\ninto the face of another if he could help it. He would look all around\\r\\nHiram when he spoke to him--at his shoulder, his shirtfront, his hands,\\r\\neven at his feet if they were visible, but never at his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at the table he kept up a continual monologue. It was difficult\\r\\nsometimes for Hiram to know when he was being addressed, and when poor\\r\\nMr. Camp was merely talking to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let\\'s see--where has Sister put my napkin--Oh! here it is--You\\'ve been\\r\\nfor a walk, have you, young man?--No, that\\'s not my napkin; I didn\\'t\\r\\nspill any gravy at dinner--Nice day out, but raw--Goodness me! can\\'t I\\r\\nhave a knife and fork?--Where\\'s my knife and fork?--Sister certainly has\\r\\nforgotten my knife and fork.--Oh! Here they are--Yes, a very nice day\\r\\nindeed for this time of year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so on. It was quite immaterial to Mr. Camp whether he got an answer\\r\\nto his remarks to Hiram, or not. He went on muttering to himself, all\\r\\nthrough the meal, sometimes commenting upon what the others said at the\\r\\ntable--and that quite shrewdly, Hiram noticed; but the other boarders\\r\\nconsidered him a little cracked.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister smiled sheepishly at Hiram as she passed the tea. She drowned\\r\\nhis tea with milk and put in no less than four spoonfuls of sugar. But\\r\\nalthough the fluid was utterly spoiled for Hiram\\'s taste he drank it\\r\\nwith fortitude, knowing that the girl\\'s generosity was the child of her\\r\\ngratitude; for both sugar and milk were articles very scantily supplied\\r\\nat Mother Atterson\\'s table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mistress herself did not appear. Now that he was down here in the\\r\\ndining-room, Hiram lingered. He hated the thought of going up to his\\r\\nlonely and narrow quarters at the top of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other boarders trailed out of the room and up stairs, one after\\r\\nanother, Old Lem Camp being the last to go. Sister brought in a dish of\\r\\nhot toast between two plates and set it at the upper end of the table.\\r\\nThen Mrs. Atterson appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram knew at once that something had gone wrong with the boarding\\r\\nhouse mistress. She had been crying, and when a woman of the age of Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson indulges in tears, her personal appearance is never improved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that you, Hi?\" she drawled, with a snuffle. \"Did you get enough to\\r\\neat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Mrs. Atterson,\" returned the youth, starting to get up. \"I have\\r\\nhad plenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad you did,\" said the lady. \"And you\\'re easy \\'side of most of\\r\\n\\'em, Hiram. You\\'re a real good boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I reckon I get all I pay for, Mrs. Atterson,\" said her youngest\\r\\nboarder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, there ain\\'t many of \\'em would say that. And they was awful\\r\\nprovokin\\' this noon. That roast of veal was just as good meat as I could\\r\\nfind in market; and I don\\'t know what any sensible party would want\\r\\nbetter than that prune pie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! I hope I won\\'t have to keep a boarding house all my life. It\\'s a\\r\\nthankless task. An\\' it ties a body down so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s my uncle--my poor mother\\'s only brother and about the only\\r\\nrelative I\\'ve got in the world--here\\'s Uncle Jeptha down with the grip,\\r\\nor suthin\\', and goodness knows if he\\'ll ever get over it. And I can\\'t\\r\\nleave to go and see him die peaceable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does he live far from here?\" asked Hiram, politely, although he had no\\r\\nparticular reason for being interested in Uncle Jeptha.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He lives on a farm out Scoville way. He\\'s lived there most all his\\r\\nlife. He used to make a right good living off\\'n that farm, too; but it\\'s\\r\\nrun down some now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The last time I was out there, two years ago, he was just keepin\\' along\\r\\nand that\\'s all. And now I expect he\\'s dying, without a chick or child\\r\\nof his own by him,\" and she burst out crying again, the tears sprinkling\\r\\nthe square of toast into which she continued to bite.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, it was ridiculous. A middle-aged woman weeping and eating\\r\\ntoast and drinking strong boiled tea is not a romantic picture. But as\\r\\nHiram climbed to his room he wished with all his heart that he could\\r\\nhelp Mrs. Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wasn\\'t the only person in the world who seemed to have got into\\r\\na wrong environment--lots of people didn\\'t fit right into their\\r\\ncircumstances in life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re square pegs in round holes--that\\'s what we are,\" mused Hiram.\\r\\n\"That\\'s what I am. I wish I was out of it. I wish I was back on the\\r\\nfarm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III. A DREARY DAY\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel Dwight\\'s Emporium, the general store was called, and it was in a\\r\\nvery populous part of the town of Crawberry. Old Daniel was a driver, he\\r\\nseldom had clerks enough to handle his trade properly, and nobody could\\r\\nsuit him. As general helper and junior clerk, Hiram Strong had remained\\r\\nwith the concern longer than any other boy Daniel had hired in years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the early Monday morning rush was over, and there was moment\\'s\\r\\nbreathing space, Hiram went to the door to re-arrange the trays of\\r\\nvegetables which were his particular care. Hiram had a knack of making\\r\\na bank of the most plebeian vegetable and salads look like the\\r\\ndisplay-window of a florist.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the youth looked out upon a typical city street, the dwellings\\r\\non either side being four and five story tenement houses, occupied by\\r\\nartisans and mechanics.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few quarreling children paddled sticks, or sailed chip boats, in the\\r\\ngutters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on, now! Get a move on you, Hi!\" sounded the raucous voice of\\r\\nDaniel Dwight the elder, behind him in the store.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram went at his task with neither interest nor energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll about him the houses and the street were grimy and depressing. It\\r\\nhad been a gray and murky morning; but overhead a patch of sky was as\\r\\nblue as June. He suddenly saw a flock of pigeons wheeling above the\\r\\ntunnel of the street, and the boy\\'s heart leaped at the sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe longed for freedom. He wished he could fly, up, up, up above the\\r\\nhousetops and the streets, like those feathered fowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew he was stagnating here in this dingy store; the deadly sameness\\r\\nof his life chafed him sorely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d take another job if I could find one,\" he muttered, stirring up the\\r\\nbunches of yellowing radish leaves and trying to make them look fresh.\\r\\n\"And Old Daniel is likely to give me a chance to hunt a job pretty\\r\\nsudden--the way he talks. But if Dan, Junior, told him what happened\\r\\nyesterday, I wonder the old gentleman hasn\\'t been after me with a sharp\\r\\nstick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom somewhere--out of the far-distant open country where it had been\\r\\nbreathing all night the quivering pines, and brown swamps, and the\\r\\nwhite and gray checkered fields that would soon be upturned by the\\r\\nplowshares--a vagrant wind wandered into the city street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lingering, but faint perfume wafted here from God\\'s open world to\\r\\ndie in this man-made town inspired in the youth thoughts and desires\\r\\nthat had been struggling within him for expression for days past.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know what I want,\" said Hiram Strong, aloud. \"I want to get back to\\r\\nthe land!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe progress of the day was not inducive to a hopeful outlook for\\r\\nHiram. When closing time came he was heartily sick of the business of\\r\\nstorekeeping, if he never had been before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he dragged himself home to the boarding house, he found the\\r\\natmosphere there as dreary as the street itself. The boarders were\\r\\ngrumpy and Mrs. Atterson was in a tearful state again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram could not stay in his room. It was a narrow, cold place at the end\\r\\nof the back hall at the top of the house. There was a little, painted\\r\\nbureau in it, one leg of which had been replaced by a brick, and the\\r\\nlittle glass was so blue and blurred that he never could see in it\\r\\nwhether his tie was straight or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a chair, a shelf for books, and a narrow folding bed. When the\\r\\nbed was dropped down for his occupancy at night, he could not get the\\r\\ndoor open. Had there ever been a fire at Atterson\\'s at night, Hiram\\'s\\r\\nbest chance for escape would have been by the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this evening, to kill the miserable stretch of time until sleep\\r\\nshould come to him, the boy went out and walked the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo things had saved Hiram Strong from getting into bad company on these\\r\\nevening rambles. One was the small amount of money he earned, and the\\r\\nother was the naturally clean nature of the boy. The cheap amusements\\r\\nwhich lured on either hand did not attract him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the dangers are there in every city, and they lurk for every boy in\\r\\na like position.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main thoroughfare in this part of the town where Hiram boarded\\r\\nwas brightly lighted, gaudy electric signs attracting notice to cheap\\r\\npicture shows, catch-penny arcades, cheap jewelry stores, and the ever\\r\\npresent saloons and pool rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt looked bright, and warm, and lively in many of these places; but the\\r\\ncountry-bred boy was cautious.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow and then a raucous-voiced automobile shot along the street; the\\r\\nelectric cars made their usual clangor, and there was still some\\r\\nordinary traffic of the day dribbling away into the side streets, for it\\r\\nwas early in the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram was about to turn into one of these side streets on his way back\\r\\nto Mrs. Atterson\\'s. Turning the corner was a handsome span of horses\\r\\nattached to a comfortable but mud-bespattered carriage. It was plainly\\r\\nfrom the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe light at the corner of the street shone brightly into the carriage.\\r\\nHiram saw a well-built man in a gray greatcoat and slouch hat, holding\\r\\nthe reins over the backs of the spirited horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside him sat a girl. She could have been no more than twelve or\\r\\nfourteen--not so old as Sister, by a year or two. But how different she\\r\\nwas from the starved-looking, boarding house slavey!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was framed in furs--rich, gray and black furs that muffled her\\r\\nfrom top to toe, only leaving her brilliant, dark little face with its\\r\\nperfect features shining like a jewel in its setting.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was talking laughingly to the big man beside her, and he was looking\\r\\ndown at her. Perhaps this was why he did not see what lay just ahead--or\\r\\nperhaps the glare of the street light blinded him, as it must have the\\r\\nhorses, as the equipage turned into the darker side street.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram saw their peril. He sprang into the street with a cry of\\r\\nwarning. And he was lucky enough to seize the nigh horse by the bridle\\r\\nand pull both the high-steppers around.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an excavation--an opening for a water-main--in this street.\\r\\nThe workmen had either neglected to leave a red lantern, or malicious\\r\\nboys had stolen it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother moment and the horses would have been in this excavation and\\r\\neven now the carriage swayed. One forward wheel went over the edge of\\r\\nthe hole, and for the minute it was doubtful whether Hiram had saved the\\r\\noccupants of the carriage by his quick action, or had accelerated the\\r\\ncatastrophe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV. THE LOST CARD\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Hiram Strong not been a muscular youth for his age, and sturdy\\r\\nwithal, the excited horses would have broken away from him and the\\r\\ncarriage would certainly have gone into the ditch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he had a grip on the bridle reins now that could not be broken,\\r\\nalthough the horses plunged and struck fire from the stones of the\\r\\nstreet with their shoes. He dragged them forward, the carriage pitched\\r\\nand rolled for a moment, and then stood upright again, squarely on its\\r\\nfour wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, lad! I\\'ve got \\'em!\" exclaimed the gentleman in the carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had a hearty, husky sort of voice--a voice that came from deep down\\r\\nin his chest and was more than a little hoarse. But there was no quiver\\r\\nof excitement in it. Indeed, he who had been in peril was much less\\r\\ndisturbed by the incident than was Hiram himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor had the girl screamed, or otherwise voiced her terror. Now Hiram\\r\\nheard her say, as he stepped back from the plunging horses:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a good boy, Daddy. Speak to him again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man in gray laughed. He was now holding in the frightened team with\\r\\none firm hand while he fumbled in the pocket of his big coat with the\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He certainly has got some muscle, that lad,\" announced the gentleman.\\r\\n\"Here, son, where can I find you when I\\'m in town again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I work at Dwight\\'s Emporium,\" replied Hiram, rather diffidently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right. Thanks. Here\\'s my card. You\\'re the kind of a boy I like.\\r\\nI\\'ll surely look you up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held out the bit of pasteboard to Hiram; but as the youth stepped\\r\\nnearer to reach it, the impatient horses sprang forward and the carriage\\r\\nrolled swiftly by him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe card flipped from the man\\'s fingers. Hiram grabbed for it, but\\r\\nmissed the card. It fluttered into the excavation in the street and the\\r\\nshadow hid it completely from the boy\\'s gaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad there been a lantern nearby, as there should have been, Hiram would\\r\\nhave taken it to search for the lost card. For he felt suddenly as\\r\\nthough Opportunity had brushed past him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man in the carriage evidently lived out of town. He might be a\\r\\nprosperous farmer. And, being a farmer, he might be able to give Hiram\\r\\njust the sort of job he was looking for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe card, of course, would have put Hiram in touch with the man. And he\\r\\nseemed like a hearty, good-natured individual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the girl--his daughter--was as pretty as a picture,\" thought Hiram,\\r\\nas he turned wearily toward the boarding house. \"Well! I don\\'t know that\\r\\nI\\'ll ever see either of them again; but if I could learn that man\\'s name\\r\\nand address I\\'d certainly look him up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much did this thought disturb him that he was up an hour earlier than\\r\\nusual the next morning and hurried to work by the way of the excavation\\r\\nin the street where the incident had occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he could not find the card, although he got down into the ditch to\\r\\nsearch for it. The loose sand, perhaps, rattling down from the sides of\\r\\nthe excavation during the night, had buried the bit of pasteboard, and\\r\\nHiram went on to Dwight\\'s Emporium more disheartened than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work there went worse that morning. Old Daniel Dwight drove the\\r\\nyoung fellow from one task to another. The other clerks got a minute\\'s\\r\\ntime to themselves now and then; but the proprietor of the store seemed\\r\\nto have his keen eyes on Hiram continually.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was always a slow-up in the work about ten o\\'clock, and Hiram had\\r\\na request to make. He asked Old Daniel for an hour off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An hour off--with all this work to do? What do you mean, boy?\" roared\\r\\nthe proprietor. \"What do you want an hour for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got an errand,\" replied Hiram, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what is it?\" snarled the old man, curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why--it\\'s a private matter. I can\\'t tell you,\" returned the youth,\\r\\ncoolly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No good, I\\'ll be bound--no good. I don\\'t see why I should let you off\\r\\nan hour----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I work many an hour overtime for you, Mr. Dwight,\" put in Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes; that\\'s all right. That\\'s the agreement. You knew you\\'d have\\r\\nto when you came to work at the Emporium. Stick to your contract, boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why don\\'t you stick to yours?\" demanded the youth, boldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eh! Eh! What do you mean by that?\" cried Mr. Dwight, glaring at Hiram\\r\\nthrough his spectacles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean that when I came to work for you seven months ago, you promised\\r\\nthat, if I suited after six months, you would raise my wages. And you\\r\\nhaven\\'t done so,\" said the young fellow, firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment the proprietor of the Emporium was dumb. It was true. He\\r\\nhad promised just that. He had got the boy cheaper by so doing. But\\r\\nnever before had he hired a boy who stayed as long as six months, so he\\r\\nhad never had to raise his wages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stammered for a moment; then a shrewd thought came to his mind.\\r\\nHe actually smiled. When Mr. Dwight smiled it was worse than when he\\r\\ndidn\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you that if you suited me I\\'d raise your pay, did I?\" he\\r\\nsnarled. \"Well, you don\\'t suit me. You never have suited me. Therefore,\\r\\nyou get no raise, young man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram was not astonished; he was only indignant. Another boy might have\\r\\nexpressed his anger by flaring up and tendering his resignation on the\\r\\nspot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram had that fear of debt in his breast which is almost always a\\r\\ncharacteristic of the frugal, country-bred person. He had saved little.\\r\\nHe had no prospect of another job. And every Saturday night he was\\r\\nexpected to pay Mrs. Atterson three dollars and a half.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At any rate, Mr. Dwight,\" he said, quietly, after a minute\\'s silence,\\r\\n\"I want an hour to myself this morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I\\'ll dock ye ten cents for it,\" declared the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can do as you like about that,\" returned Hiram, and he walked into\\r\\nthe back room, took off his apron, and got into his coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had it in mind to go to the big market, where the farmers drove in\\r\\nfrom out of town, and see if he could meet one of his old neighbors,\\r\\nor anybody else who could tell him of prospect of work for the coming\\r\\nseason. It was early yet for farmers to be looking for extra hands; but\\r\\nHiram hoped that he might see something in prospect for the future. He\\r\\nhad made up his mind that, if possible, he would not take another job in\\r\\ntown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can see pretty plainly that I\\'ve got about through at the\\r\\nEmporium,\" he thought, as he approached the open space devoted by the\\r\\nCity of Crawberry to a market for the truckmen and farmers who drove in\\r\\nwith their wares from the surrounding country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time of day the bustle of market was over. The farmers would\\r\\nhave had their breakfasts in the little restaurants which encircled the\\r\\nmarket-place, or would be preparing to drive home again. The hucksters\\r\\nand push-cart merchants were picking up \"seconds\" and lot-ends of\\r\\nvegetables for their trade. The cobbles of the market-place was a litter\\r\\nof cabbage leaves, spilled sprouts, spoiled potatoes, and other refuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram walked about, looking for somebody whom he knew; but most of the\\r\\nfaces around the market were strange to him. Several farmers he spoke to\\r\\nabout work; but they were not hiring hands, so, when his hour was up, he\\r\\nwent back to the Emporium, more despondent than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V. THE COMMOTION AT MOTHER ATTERSON\\'S\\r\\n\\r\\nBy chance that evening Hiram got home to his boarding house in good\\r\\nseason. The early boarders--\"early birds\" Crackit always termed\\r\\nthem--had not yet sat down to the long table in the dingy dining-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the supper gong had not been pounded by Sister, and some of the\\r\\nyoung men were grouped impatiently in the half-lighted parlor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the swinging door into the steaming kitchen Hiram saw a huge\\r\\nblack woman waddling about the range, and heard her husky voice berating\\r\\nSister for not moving faster. Chloe only appeared when a catastrophe\\r\\nhappened at the boarding-house--and a catastrophe meant the removal of\\r\\nMrs. Atterson from her usual orbit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She\\'s gone to the funeral. That Uncle Jeptha of hern is dead,\"\\r\\nwhispered Sister in Hiram\\'s ear when she put his soup in front of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah-ha!\" observed Mr. Crackit, eyeing Hiram with his head on one side,\\r\\n\"secrets, eh? Inside information of what\\'s in the pudding sauce?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing went right at the boarding-house during the next two days. And\\r\\nfor Hiram Strong nothing seemed to go right anywhere!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe demanded--and got the permission, with another ten-cent tax--another\\r\\nhour off to visit the market. But he found nobody who would hire a boy\\r\\nat once. Some of the farmers doubted if he knew as much about farm-work\\r\\nas he claimed to know. He was, after all, a boy, and some of them would\\r\\nnot believe that he had even worked in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAffairs at the Emporium were getting strained, too. Daniel Dwight was as\\r\\nshrewd a man as the next one. He saw plainly that his junior clerk was\\r\\ngetting ready--like the many who had gone before him--for a flitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew the signs of discontent, although Hiram prided himself on doing\\r\\nhis work just as well as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, there was a squabble with Dan, Junior. The imp was always\\r\\nunderfoot on Saturdays. He was supposed to help--to run errands, and\\r\\ntake out in a basket certain orders to nearby customers who might be in\\r\\na hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut usually when you wanted the boy he was in the alley pitching buttons\\r\\nwith loafing urchins of his own kind--\"alley rats\" his father angrily\\r\\ncalled them--or leading a predatory gang of the same unsavory companions\\r\\nin raids on other stores in the neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Dan, Junior \"had it in\" for Hiram. He had not forgiven the bigger\\r\\nboy for pitching him into the puddle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' them was my best clo\\'es, and now maw says I\\'ve got to wear \\'em just\\r\\nthe same on Sunday, and they\\'re shrunk and stained,\" snarled the younger\\r\\nDan, hovering about Hiram as the latter re-dressed the fruit stand\\r\\nduring a moment\\'s let-up in the Saturday morning rush. \"Gimme an\\r\\norange.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! At five cents apiece?\" exclaimed Hiram. \"Guess not. Go look in\\r\\nthe basket under the bench; maybe there\\'s a specked one there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nope. Dad took \\'em all home last night and maw cut out the specks and\\r\\nsliced \\'em for supper. Gimme a good orange.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask your father,\" said Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naw, I won\\'t!\" declared young Dwight, knowing very well what his\\r\\nfather\\'s answer would be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suddenly made a grab for the golden globe on the apex of Hiram\\'s\\r\\nhandsomest pyramid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let that alone, Dan!\" cried Hiram, and seized the youngster by the\\r\\nwrist.\\r\\n\\r\\nDan, Junior, was a wiry little scamp, and he twisted and turned, and\\r\\nkicked and squalled, and Hiram was just wrenching the orange from his\\r\\nhand when Mr. Dwight came to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this? What\\'s this?\" he demanded. \"Fighting, are ye? Why don\\'t\\r\\nyou tackle a fellow of your own size, Hi Strong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that Dan, Junior, saw his chance and broke into woeful sobs. He was a\\r\\ngood actor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve a mind to turn you over to a policeman, Hiram,\" cried \"Mr. Dwight,\\r\\nThat\\'s what I\\'ve a mind to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you\\'ll discharge me first, won\\'t you?\" suggested Hiram,\\r\\nscornfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can come in and git your money right now, young man,\" said the\\r\\nproprietor of the Emporium. \"Dan! let them oranges alone. And don\\'t you\\r\\ngo away from here. I\\'ll want you all day to-day. I shall be short-handed\\r\\nwith this young scalawag leaving me in the lurch like this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had come so suddenly that Hiram almost lost his breath. He had part\\r\\nof his wish, that was sure. He was not likely to work for Daniel Dwight\\r\\nany longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man led the way back to his office. He had a little pile of\\r\\nmoney already counted out upon the desk. It was plain that he had\\r\\nintended quarreling with Hiram and getting rid of him at this time,\\r\\nfor he had the young fellow\\'s wages figured up to t hat very hour--and\\r\\ntwenty cents deducted for the two hours Hiram had had \"off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that isn\\'t fair. I\\'m willing to work to the end of the day. I ought\\r\\nto get my wages in full for the week, save for the twenty cents,\" said\\r\\nHiram mildly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo tell the truth, now that he had lost his job--unpleasant as it had\\r\\nbeen--Hiram was more than a little troubled. He was indeed about to be\\r\\ncast adrift.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll git jest that sum, and not a cent more,\" declared Mr. Dwight,\\r\\nsharply. \"And if you start any trouble here I\\'ll call in the officer on\\r\\nthe beat--yes, I will! I don\\'t know but I ought to deduct the cost of\\r\\nDan, Junior\\'s, spoiled suit, too. He says you an\\' he was skylarkin\\' on\\r\\nSunday and that\\'s how he fell into the water.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had no answer to make to this. What was the use? He took the\\r\\nmoney, slipped it into his pocket, and went out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not linger around the Emporium. Nor was he scarcely out of sight\\r\\nwhen a man driving a span of handsome bay horses halted his team before\\r\\nthe store, jumped out, and went in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you the proprietor of Dwight\\'s Emporium?\" asked the man in the\\r\\ngray coat and hat, in his hearty tones. \"You are? Glad to meet you! I\\'m\\r\\nlooking for a young man who works for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s that? What do you want of him?\" asked Dan, Senior, doubtfully,\\r\\nand rubbing his hand, for the stranger\\'s grip had been as hearty as his\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other laughed in his jovial way. \"Why, to tell the truth, I don\\'t\\r\\nknow his name. I didn\\'t ask him. He\\'s not much more than a boy--a sturdy\\r\\nyoungster with a quick way with him. He did me a service the other\\r\\nevening and I wanted to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There ain\\'t any boy working here,\" snapped Mr. Dwight. \"Them\\'s all\\r\\nthe clerks I got behind the counter--and there ain\\'t one of \\'em under\\r\\nthirty, I\\'ll be bound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s so,\" admitted the stranger. \"And although it was so dark I could\\r\\nnot see that fellow\\'s face, and I didn\\'t ask his name, I am sure he was\\r\\nyoung.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I jest discharged the only boy I had--and scamp enough he was,\" snarled\\r\\nMr. Dwight. \"If you were looking for him, you\\'d have been sorry to find\\r\\nhim. I didn\\'t know but I\\'d have to send for a policeman to git him off\\r\\nthe premises.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What--what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what I tell you. He was a bad egg. Mebbe he\\'s the boy you\\r\\nwant--but you won\\'t get no good of him when you find him. And I\\'ve no\\r\\nidea where he\\'s to be found now,\" and the old man turned his back on the\\r\\nman in the gray coat and went into his office.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger climbed back into his buggy and took up the lines again\\r\\nwith a preoccupied headshake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, I promised Lettie,\" he muttered, \"that I\\'d find out all about that\\r\\nboy--and maybe bring him home with me. Funny that man gave his such\\r\\na bad character. Wish I could have seen the lad\\'s face the other\\r\\nnight--that would have told the story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" and he dismissed the matter with a sigh, for he was busy man,\\r\\n\"if he\\'s got my card, and he is out of a job, perhaps he\\'ll look me up.\\r\\nThen we\\'ll see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI. THIS DIDN\\'T GET BY HIRAM\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve sure got plenty of time now to look for a job,\" observed Hiram\\r\\nStrong when he was two blocks away from Dwight\\'s Emporium. \"But I\\r\\ndeclare I don\\'t know where to begin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his experience in talking with the farmers around the market had\\r\\nrather dashed Hiram\\'s hope of getting a place in the country at once. It\\r\\nwas too early in the season. Nor did it look so much like Spring as it\\r\\nhad a week ago. Already Hiram had to turn up the collar of his rough\\r\\ncoat, and a few flakes of snow were settling on his shoulders as he\\r\\nwalked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s winter yet,\" he mused. \"If I can\\'t get something to do in the\\r\\ncity for a few weeks to tide me over, I\\'m afraid I shall have to find a\\r\\ncheaper place to board than at Mother Atterson\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter half an hour of strolling from street to street, however, Hiram\\r\\ndecided that there was nothing in that game. He must break in somewhere,\\r\\nso he turned into the very next warehouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Want a job? I\\'ll be looking for one myself pretty soon, if business\\r\\nisn\\'t better,\" was the answer he got from the first man he approached.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram kept at it, and got short answers and long answers, pleasant\\r\\nones and some that were not so pleasant; but all could be summed up in\\r\\nthe single monosyllable:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly am a failure here in town,\" Hiram thought, as he walked\\r\\nthrough the snow-blown streets. \"How foolish I was ever to have come\\r\\naway from the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A fellow ought to stick to the job he is fitted for--and that\\'s sure.\\r\\nBut I didn\\'t know. I thought there would be forty chances in town to one\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And there doesn\\'t seem to be a single chance right now. Why, I\\'ll have\\r\\nto leave Mrs. Atterson\\'s, if I can\\'t find a job before next week is out!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This mean old town is over-crowded with fellows like me looking for\\r\\nwork. And when it comes to office positions, I haven\\'t a high-school\\r\\ndiploma, nor am I fitted for that kind of a job.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to be out of doors. Working in a stuffy office wouldn\\'t suit me.\\r\\nOh, as a worker in the city I am a rank failure, and that\\'s all there is\\r\\nabout it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went home to supper much more tired than he would have been had he\\r\\ndone a full day\\'s work at Dwight\\'s Emporium. Indeed, the job he had lost\\r\\nnow loomed up in his troubled mind as much more important than it had\\r\\nseemed when he had desired to change it for another.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Atterson was at home. She hadn\\'t more than taken off her bonnet,\\r\\nhowever, and had had but a single clash with Chloe in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I smelled it burnin\\' the minute I set my foot on the front step!\"\\r\\nshe declared. \"You can\\'t fool my nose when it comes to smelling burned\\r\\nstuff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Hiram,\" she continued, too full of news to remark that he was at\\r\\nhome long before his time, \"I saw the poor old soul laid away, at least.\\r\\nI wish now I\\'d got Chloe in before, and gone to see Uncle Jeptha before\\r\\nhe was in his coffin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I didn\\'t think I could afford it, and that\\'s a fact. We poor folks\\r\\ncan\\'t have many pleasures in this world of toil and trouble!\" added\\r\\nthe boarding house mistress, to whom even the break of a funeral, or a\\r\\ndeath-bed visit, was in the nature of a solemn amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And there the old man went and made his will years ago, unbeknownst to\\r\\nanybody, and me bein\\' his only blood relation, as you might say, though\\r\\nit was years since I seen him much, but he remembered my mother with\\r\\nlove,\" and she began to wipe her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor old man! And me with a white-faced cow that I\\'m afraid of my life\\r\\nof, and an old horse that looks like a moth-eaten hide trunk we to\\r\\nhave in our garret at home when I was a little girl, and belonged to my\\r\\ngreat-great-grandmother Atterson----\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And there\\'s a mess of chickens that eat all day long and don\\'t lay an\\r\\negg as far as I could see, besides a sow and a litter of six pigs that\\r\\nsqueal worse than the the switch-engine down yonder in the freight\\r\\nyard----\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they\\'re all to be fed, and how I\\'m to do it, and feed the boarders,\\r\\ntoo, I don\\'t for the life of me see!\" finished Mrs. Atterson, completely\\r\\nout of breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" cried Hiram, suddenly waking to the significance of\\r\\nthe old lady\\'s chatter. \"Do you mean he willed you these things?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" she returned, smoothing down her best black skirt. \"They\\r\\ngo with the house and outbuildings--`all the chattels and appurtenances\\r\\nthereto\\', the will read.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Mrs. Atterson!\" gasped Hiram. \"He must have left you the farm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what I said,\" returned the old lady, complacently. \"And what I\\'m\\r\\nto do with it I\\'ve no more idea than the man in the moon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A farm!\" repeated Hiram, his face flushing and his eyes beginning to\\r\\nshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Hiram Strong was not a particularly handsome youth, but in his\\r\\nexcitement he almost looked so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eighty acres, so many rods, and so many perches,\" pursued Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson, nodding. \"That\\'s the way it reads. The perches is in the\\r\\nhenhouse, I s\\'pose--though why the description included them and not the\\r\\nhens\\' nests I dunno.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eighty acres of land!\" repeated Hiram in a daze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All free and clear. Not a dollar against it--only encumbrances is the\\r\\nchickens, the cow, the horse and the pigs,\" declared Mrs. Atterson. \"If\\r\\nit wasn\\'t for them it might not be so bad. Scoville\\'s an awfully nice\\r\\nplace, and the farm\\'s on an automobile road. A body needn\\'t go blind\\r\\nlooking for somebody to go by the door occasionally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if it got so bad here finally that I couldn\\'t make a livin\\' keeping\\r\\nboarders,\" pursued the lady, \"I might go out there and live in the old\\r\\nhouse--which isn\\'t much, I know, but it\\'s a shelter, and my tastes are\\r\\nsimple, goodness knows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But a farm, Mrs. Atterson!\" broke in Hiram. \"Think what you can do with\\r\\nit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what I\\'d like to have, you, or somebody else tell me,\" exclaimed\\r\\nthe old lady, tartly. \"I ain\\'t got no more use for a farm than a cat has\\r\\nfor two tails!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--but isn\\'t it a good farm?\" queried Hiram, puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do I know?\" snapped the boarding house mistress. \"I wouldn\\'t know\\r\\none farm from another, exceptin\\' two can\\'t be in exactly the same spot.\\r\\nOh! do you mean, could I sell it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The lawyer advised me not to sell just now. He said something about the\\r\\nstate of the real estate market in that section. Prices would be better\\r\\nin a year or two. And then, the old place is mighty run down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what I mean,\" Hiram hastened to say. \"Has it been cropped to\\r\\ndeath? Is the soil worn out? Can\\'t you run it and make something out of\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For pity\\'s sake!\" ejaculated the good lady, \"how should I know? And I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t run it--I shouldn\\'t know how.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got a neighbor-woman in the house just now to \\'tend to things--and\\r\\nthat\\'s costin\\' me a dollar and a half a week. And there\\'ll be taxes to\\r\\npay, and--and--Well, I just guess I\\'ll have to try and sell it now and\\r\\ntake what I can get.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though that lawyer says that if the place was fixed up a little and\\r\\ncrops put in it would make a thousand dollars\\' difference in the selling\\r\\nprice. That is, after a year or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But bless us and save us\" cried Mrs. Atterson, \"I\\'d be swamped with\\r\\nexpenses before that time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mebbe not,\" said Hiram Strong, trying to repress his eagerness. \"Why\\r\\nnot try it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Try to run that farm?\" cried she. \"Why, I\\'d jest as lief go up in one\\r\\no\\' those aeroplanes and try to run it. I wouldn\\'t be no more up in the\\r\\nair then than I would be on a farm,\" she added, grimly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get somebody to run it for you--do the outside work, I mean, Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson,\" said Hiram. \"You could keep house out there just as well as\\r\\nyou do here. And it would be easy for you to learn to milk----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That whitefaced cow? My goodness! I\\'d just as quick learn to milk a\\r\\nswitch-engine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it\\'s only her head that looks so wicked to you,\" laughed Hiram.\\r\\n\"And you don\\'t milk that end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--mebbe,\" admitted Mrs. Atterson, doubtfully. \"I reckon I could\\r\\nmake butter again--I used to do that when I was a girl at my aunt\\'s. And\\r\\neither I\\'d make those hens lay or I\\'d have their dratted heads off!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my goodness me! To get rid of the boarders--Oh, stop your talkin\\',\\r\\nHi Strong! That is too good to ever be true. Don\\'t talk to me no more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I want to talk to you, Mrs. Atterson,\" persisted the youth,\\r\\neagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, who\\'d I get to do the outside work--put in crops, and \\'tend \\'em,\\r\\nand look out for that old horse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram almost choked. This opportunity should not get past him if he\\r\\ncould help it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me do it, Mrs. Atterson. Give me a chance to show you what I can\\r\\ndo,\" he cried. \"Let me run the farm for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why--why do you suppose that it could be made to pay us, Hi?\" demanded\\r\\nhis landlady, in wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Other farms pay; why not this one?\" rejoined Hiram, sententiously. \"Of\\r\\ncourse,\" he added, his native caution coming to the surface, \"I\\'d want\\r\\nto see the place--to look it over pretty well, in fact--before I made\\r\\nany agreement. And I can assure you, Mrs. Atterson, if I saw no chance\\r\\nof both you and me making something out of it I should tell you so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--but your job, Hiram? And I wouldn\\'t approve of your going out\\r\\nthere and lookin\\' at the place on a Sunday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll take the early train Monday morning,\" said the youth, promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what will they say at the store? Mr. Dwight----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He turned me off to-day,\" said Hiram, steadily. \"So I won\\'t lose\\r\\nanything by going out there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you what I\\'ll do,\" he added briskly. \"I won\\'t have any too much\\r\\nmoney while I\\'m out of a job, of course. And I shall be out there at\\r\\nScoville a couple of days looking the place over, it\\'s probable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, if you will let me keep this three dollars and a half I should\\r\\npay you for my next week\\'s board to-night, I\\'ll pay my own expenses out\\r\\nthere at the farm and if nothing comes of it, all well and good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson had fumbled for her spectacles and now put them on to\\r\\nsurvey the boy\\'s earnest face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to say you can run a farm, Hi Strong?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do,\" and he smiled confidently at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And make it pay?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps not much profit the first season; but if the farm is fertile,\\r\\nand the marketing conditions are right, I know I can make it pay us both\\r\\nin two years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got a little money saved up. I could sell the house in a week, for\\r\\nit\\'s always full and there are always lone women like me with a little\\r\\ndriblet of money to exchange for a boarding house--heaven help us for\\r\\nthe fools we are!\" Mrs. Atterson exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I expect you could raise vegetables enough to part keep us, Hi,\\r\\neven if the farm wasn\\'t a great success?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And eggs, and chickens, and the pigs, and milk from the cow,\" suggested\\r\\nHiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! I declare, that\\'s so,\" admitted Mrs. Atterson. \"I\\'d been lookin\\'\\r\\non all them things as an expense. They could be made an asset, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should hope so,\" responded Hiram, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I could get rid of these boarders--My soul and body!\" gasped\\r\\nthe tired woman, suddenly. \"Do you suppose it\\'s true, Hi? Get rid of\\r\\nworryin\\' about paying the bills, and whether the boarders are all going\\r\\nto keep their jobs and be able to pay regularly--And the gravy!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hiram Strong! If you can show me a way out of this valley of\\r\\ntribulation I\\'ll be the thankfullest woman that you ever seen. It\\'s a\\r\\nbargain. Don\\'t you pay me a cent for this coming week. And I shouldn\\'t\\r\\nhave taken it, anyway, when you\\'re throwed out of work so. That\\'s a\\r\\nmighty mean man, that Daniel Dwight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You go right ahead and look that farm over. If it looks good, you come\\r\\nback and we\\'ll strike a bargain, I know. And--and--Just to think\\r\\nof getting rid of this house and these boarders!\" and Mrs. Atterson\\r\\nfinished by wiping her eyes again vigorously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII. HOW HIRAM LEFT TOWN\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram Strong was up betimes on Monday morning--Sister saw to that. She\\r\\nrapped on his door at four-thirty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes Hiram wondered when the girl ever slept. She was still\\r\\ndragging about the kitchen or dining-room when he went to bed, and she\\r\\nwas first down in the morning--even earlier than Mrs. Atterson herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boarding house mistress was not intentionally severe with Sister;\\r\\nbut the much harassed lady had never learned to make her own work easy,\\r\\nso how should she be expected to be easy on Sister?\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce or twice Hiram had talked with the orphan. Sister had a dreadful\\r\\nfear of returning to the \"institution\" from which Mrs. Atterson had\\r\\ntaken her. And Sister\\'s other fearful remembrance was of an old woman\\r\\nwho beat her and drank much gin and water.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that she had been ill-treated at the institution; but she had been\\r\\ndressed in an ugly uniform, and the girls had been rough and pulled her\\r\\n\"pigtails\" like Dan, Junior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Once a gentleman came to see me,\" Sister confided to Hiram. \"He was\\r\\na lawyer gentleman, the matron told me. He knew my name--but I\\'ve\\r\\nforgotten it now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he said that somebody who once belonged to me--or I once belonged\\r\\nto them--had died and perhaps there would be some money coming to me.\\r\\nBut it couldn\\'t have been the old woman I lived with, for she never had\\r\\nonly money enough for gin!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anyhow, I was glad. I axed him how much money--was it enough to treat\\r\\nall the girls in the institution one round of ice-cream soda, and he\\r\\nlaffed, he did. And he said yes--just about enough for that, if he could\\r\\nget it for me. And I ran away and told the girls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I promised them all a treat. But the man never came again, and by and\\r\\nby the big girls said they believed I storied about it, and one night\\r\\nthey came and dragged me out of bed and hung me out of the window by my\\r\\nwrists, till I thought my arms would be pulled right out of the sockets.\\r\\nThey was awful cruel--them girls. But when I axed the matron why the\\r\\nman didn\\'t come no more, she put me off. I guess he was only\\r\\nfoolin\\',\" decided Sister, with a sigh. \"Folks like to fool me--like Mr.\\r\\nCrackit--eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs. Atterson told Hiram, when he asked about Sister\\'s meagre little\\r\\nstory, that the institution had promised to let her know if the lawyer\\r\\never returned to make further inquiries about the orphan. Somebody\\r\\nreally had died who was of kin to the girl, but through some error the\\r\\ninstitution had not made a proper record of her pedigree and the lawyer\\r\\nwho had instituted the search a seemed to have dropped out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram was not troubled by poor Sister\\'s private affairs upon this\\r\\nMonday morning. It was the beginning of a new week, indeed, to him. He\\r\\nhad turned over a new leaf of experience. He hoped that he was pretty\\r\\nnear to the end of his harsh city existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hurried downstairs, long in advance of the other boarders, and Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson served him some breakfast, although there was no milk for the\\r\\ncoffee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dunno where that plague o\\' my life, Sister\\'s, gone,\" sputtered the\\r\\nold lady, fussing about, between dining-room and kitchen. \"I sent her\\r\\nout ten minutes ago for the milk. And if you want to get that first\\r\\ntrain to Scoville you\\'ve got to hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind the milk,\" laughed the young fellow. \"The train\\'s more\\r\\nimportant this morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he bolted the remainder of his breakfast, swallowed the black coffee,\\r\\nand ran out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe arrived at Scoville while the morning was still young. It was not his\\r\\nintention to go at once to the Atterson farm. There were matters which\\r\\nhe desired to look into in addition to judging the quality of the soil\\r\\non the place and the possibility of making it pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to the storekeepers and asked questions about the prices paid\\r\\nfor garden truck. He walked about the town and saw the quality of\\r\\nthe residences, and noted what proportion of the townsfolk cultivated\\r\\ngardens of their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a big girls\\' boarding-school, and two small, but\\r\\nwell-patronized hotels. The proprietors of these each owned a farm;\\r\\nbut they told Hiram that it was necessary for them to buy much of their\\r\\ntable vegetables from city produce men, as the neighboring farmers did\\r\\nnot grow much.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn talking with one storekeeper Hiram mentioned the fact that he was\\r\\ngoing to look at the Atterson place with a view to farming it for its\\r\\nnew owner. When he walked out of the store he found himself accosted\\r\\nby a lean, snaky-looking man who had stood within the store the moment\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this widder woman goin\\' to do with the farm old Jeptha left\\r\\nher?\" inquired the man, looking at Hiram slyly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We don\\'t know yet, sir, what we shall do with it,\" the young fellow\\r\\nreplied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You her son?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. I may work for her--can\\'t tell till I\\'ve looked at the place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ain\\'t much to look at,\" said the man, quickly. \"I come near buying\\r\\nit once, though. In fact--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated, still eyeing Hiram sideways. The boy waited for him to\\r\\nspeak again. He did not wish to be impolite; but he did not like the\\r\\nman\\'s appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do y\\' reckon this Mis\\' Atterson would sell for?\" finally demanded\\r\\nthe man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has been advised not to sell--at present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who by?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Strickland, the lawyer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Humph! Mebbe I\\'d buy it--and give her a good price for it--right now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you consider a good price?\" asked Hiram, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twelve hundred dollars,\" said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will tell her. But I do not think she would sell for that\\r\\nprice--nothing like it, in fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, mebbe she\\'ll feel different when she comes to think it over.\\r\\nNo use for a woman trying to run a farm. And if she has to pay for\\r\\neverything to be done, she\\'ll be in a hole at the end of the season. I\\r\\nguess she ain\\'t thought of that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It wouldn\\'t be my place to point it out to her,\" returned Hiram,\\r\\n\"coolly, if it were so, and I wanted to work for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Humph! Mebbe not. Well, my name\\'s Pepper. Mebbe I\\'ll be out to see her\\r\\nsome day,\" he said, and turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s one of the people who will discourage Mrs. Atterson,\" thought\\r\\nHiram. \"And he has an axe to grind. If I decide to take the job of\\r\\nmaking this farm pay, I\\'m going to have the agreement in black and\\r\\nwhite with Mrs. Atterson; for there will be a raft of Job\\'s comforters,\\r\\nperhaps when we get settled on the place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late in the afternoon before Hiram was ready to start for the\\r\\nfarm itself. He had made some enquiries, and had decided to stop at a\\r\\nneighbor\\'s for overnight, instead of going to the house where a lone\\r\\nwoman had been left in charge by Mrs. Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pollocks had been recommended to Hiram, and by leaving the road\\r\\nwithin half a mile of the Atterson farm, and cutting across the fields,\\r\\nhe came into the dooryard of the Pollock place. A well-grown boy, not\\r\\nmuch older than himself, was splitting some chunks at the woodpile. He\\r\\nstopped work to gaze at the visitor with much curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From what they told me in town,\" Hi said, holding out his hand with a\\r\\nsmile, \"you must be Henry Pollock?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy blushed, but awkwardly took and shook Hi\\'s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what they call me--Henry Pollock--when they don\\'t call me Hen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll make a bargain with you, Henry,\" laughed Hiram. \"I don\\'t\\r\\nlike to have my name cut off short, either. My name\\'s Hiram Strong. So\\r\\nif you\\'ll agree to always call me `Hiram\\' I\\'ll always call you `Henry.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a go!\" returned the other, shaking hands again. \"You going to live\\r\\naround here? Or are you jest visiting?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know yet,\" confessed Hiram, sitting down beside the boy. \"You\\r\\nsee, I\\'ve come out to look at the Atterson place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right over yonder. You can see the roof if you stand up,\" said\\r\\nHenry, quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram stood up and, in the light of the early sunset, he caught a\\r\\nglimpse of the roof in question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your folks going to buy it of the old lady Uncle Jeptha left it to?\"\\r\\nasked Henry, with pardonable curiosity. \"Or are you going to rent it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of renting it?\" queried Hiram, showing that he had\\r\\nYankee blood in him by answering one question with another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--it\\'s pretty well run down, and that\\'s a fact. The old man\\r\\ncouldn\\'t do much the last few years, and them Dickersons who farmed it\\r\\nfor him ain\\'t no great shakes of farmers, now I tell you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I want to look the farm over before I decide what I\\'ll do,\" said\\r\\nHiram, slowly. \"And of course I can\\'t do that to-night. They told me in\\r\\ntown that sometimes you take boarders?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the summer we do,\" returned Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think your folks will put me up overnight?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I reckon so--Hiram Strong, did you say your name was? Come right\\r\\nin,\" added Henry, hospitably, \"and I\\'ll ask mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII. THE LURE OF GREEN FIELDS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pollocks proved to be a neighborly family--and a large one. As Henry\\r\\nsaid, there was a \"whole raft of young \\'uns\" younger than he was. They\\r\\nmade Hiram very welcome at the supper table, and showed much curiosity\\r\\nabout his personal affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the young fellow had been used to just such people before. They were\\r\\nnot a bad sort, and if they were keenly interested in the affairs of\\r\\nother people, it was because they had few books and newspapers, and\\r\\nsmall chance to amuse themselves in the many ways which city people\\r\\nhave.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram slept with Henry that night, and Henry agreed to show the visitor\\r\\nover the Atterson place the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know every stick and stone of it as well as I do ourn,\" declared\\r\\nHenry. \"And Dad won\\'t mind my taking time now. Later--Whew! I tell you,\\r\\nwe hafter just git up an\\' dust to make a crop. Not much chance for fun\\r\\nafter a week or two until the corn\\'s laid by.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know all the boundaries of the Atterson farm, do you?\" Hiram asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir!\" replied Henry, eagerly. \"And say! do you like to fish?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course; who doesn\\'t?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then we\\'ll take some lines and hooks along--and mother\\'ll lend us a pan\\r\\nand kettle. Say! We\\'ll start early--\\'fore anybody\\'s a-stir--and I bet\\r\\nthere\\'ll be a big trout jumping in the pool under the big sycamore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That certain-sure sounds good to me!\" cried Hiram, enthusiastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it was agreed, and before day, while the mist was yet rolling across\\r\\nthe fields, and the hedge sparrows were beginning to chirp, the two set\\r\\nforth from the Pollock place, crossed the wet fields, and the road, and\\r\\nset off down the slope of a long hill, following, as Henry said, near\\r\\nthe east boundary of the Atterson farm--the line running from the\\r\\nautomobile road to the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a dull spring morning. The faint breeze that stirred on the\\r\\nhillside was damp, but odorous with new-springing herbs. As Hiram\\r\\nand Henry descended the aisle of the pinewood, the treetops whispered\\r\\ntogether as though curious of these bold humans who disturbed their\\r\\nsolitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It doesn\\'t look as though anybody had been here at the back end of old\\r\\nJeptha Atterson\\'s farm for years,\" said Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it\\'s a fact that nobody gets down this way often,\" Henry responded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brown tags sprung under their feet; now and then a dew-wet branch\\r\\nswept Hiram\\'s cheek, seeking with its cold fingers to stay his progress.\\r\\nIt was an enchanted forest, and the boy, heart-hungry from his two years\\r\\nof city life, was enchanted, too!\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram learned from talking with his companion that at one time the\\r\\npiece of thirty-year-old timber they were walking through had been\\r\\ntilled--after a fashion. But it had never been properly cleared, as the\\r\\nhacked and ancient stumpage betrayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere and there the lines of corn rows which had been plowed when the\\r\\nlast crop was laid by were plainly revealed to Hiram\\'s observing eye.\\r\\nWhere corn had grown once, it should grow again; and the pine timber\\r\\nwould more than pay for being cut, for blowing out the big stumps with\\r\\ndynamite, and tam-harrowing the side hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally they reached a point where the ground fell away more abruptly\\r\\nand the character of the timber changed, as well. Instead of the stately\\r\\npines, this more abrupt declivity was covered with hickory and oak. The\\r\\nsparse brush sprang out of rank, black mold.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharmed by the prospect, Hiram and Henry descended this hill and came\\r\\nsuddenly, through a fringe of brush, to the border of an open cove, or\\r\\nbottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some time this lowland, too, had been cleared and cultivated; but now\\r\\nyoung pines, quick-springing and lush, dotted the five or six acres of\\r\\npractically open land which was as level as one\\'s palm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was two hundred yards, or more, in width and at the farther side\\r\\na hedge of alders and pussywillows grew, with the green mist of young\\r\\nleaves upon them, and here and there a ghostly sycamore, stretching its\\r\\nslender bole into the air, edged the course of the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram viewed the scene with growing delight. His eyes sparkled and\\r\\na smile came to his lips as he crossed, with springy steps, the open\\r\\nmeadow on which the grass was already showing green in patches.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the line of the wood they had left and the breadth of the meadow\\r\\nwas a narrow, marshy strip into which a few stones had been cast, and on\\r\\nthese they crossed dry shod. The remainder of the bottom-land was firm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ain\\'t this jest a scrumptious place?\" demanded Henry, and Hiram agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the river\\'s edge they parted the bushes and looked down upon the\\r\\noily-flowing brown flood. It was some thirty feet broad and with the\\r\\nmelting of the snows in the mountains was so deep that no sign was\\r\\napparent here of the rocks which covered its bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry led the way up the bank of the stream toward a huge sycamore that\\r\\nleaned lovingly over the water. An ancient wild grape vine, its\\r\\nbutt four inches through and its roots fairly in the water, had a\\r\\nstrangle-hold upon this decrepit forest monarch, its tendrils reaching\\r\\nthe sycamore\\'s topmost branch.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the tree was a deep hole where flotsam leaves and twigs performed\\r\\nan endless treadmill dance in the grasp of the eddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, while their gaze clung to the dimpling water, there was a\\r\\nflash of a bronze body--a streak of light along the surface of the\\r\\npool--and two widening circles showed where the master of the hole had\\r\\nleaped for some insect prey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See him?\" called Henry, but under his breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram nodded, but squeezed his companion\\'s hand for silence. He almost\\r\\nheld his own breath for the moment, as they moved back from the pool\\r\\nwith the soundless step of an Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That big feller is my meat,\" declared Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go to it, boy!\" urged Hiram, and set about preparing the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe cut with his big jack-knife and set up a tripod of green rods in a\\r\\njiffy, skirmished for dry wood, lit his fire, filled the kettle from the\\r\\nriver at a little distance from the eddy, and hung it over the blaze to\\r\\nboil.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Henry fished out a line and an envelope of hooks from an inner\\r\\npocket, cut a springy pole back on the hillside, rigged his line and\\r\\nhook, and kicked a hole in the soft, rich soil until he unearthed a fat\\r\\nangleworm.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this impaled upon the hook he cautiously approached the pool under\\r\\nthe sycamore and cast gently. The struggling worm sank slowly; the water\\r\\nwrinkled about the line; but there followed no tug at the hook, although\\r\\nHenry stood patiently for several moments. He cast again, and yet again,\\r\\nwith like result.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, ba!\" muttered Hiram, in his ear; \"this fellow\\'s appetite needs\\r\\ntickling. He is being fed too well and turns up his nose at a common\\r\\nearthworm, does he? Let me show you a wrinkle, Henry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry drew the line ashore again and shook off the useless bait.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re, not fishing,\" Hiram continued with a grim smile. \"You\\'ve just\\r\\nbeen drowning a worm. But I\\'ll show that old fellow sulking down below\\r\\nthere that he is no match this early in the spring for a pair of hungry\\r\\nboys!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe recrossed the meadow, and the stepping stones, to the wood. He had\\r\\nnoticed a log lying in the path as he descended the hillside. With the\\r\\ntoe of his boot he kicked a patch of bark from the log, and thereby lay\\r\\nbare the wavering trail of a busy grub. Following the trail he quickly\\r\\nfound the fat, juicy insect, which immediately took the earthworm\\'s\\r\\nplace upon the hook.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Henry cast and this time, before the grub even touched the surface\\r\\nof the pool, the fish leaped and swallowed the tempting morsel, hook and\\r\\nall!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no playing of the fish on Henry\\'s part. A quick jerk and the\\r\\ngasping spotted beauty, a pound and a quarter, or more, in weight, lay\\r\\nupon the sward beside the crackling fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whoop-ee!\" called Henry, excitedly. \"That\\'s Number One!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Hiram dexterously scaled and cleaned the first trout, Henry caught\\r\\na couple more. Hiram brought forth, too, the coffee, salt and pepper,\\r\\nsugar, a piece of fat salt pork and two table knives and forks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raked a smooth bed in the glowing coals, sliced the pork thin, laid\\r\\nsome slices in the pan and set that upon the coals, where the pork began\\r\\nto sputter almost at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe water in the kettle was boiling and he made the coffee. Then he laid\\r\\nthe trout upon the pan with three slices of pork upon each, and sat\\r\\nback upon his haunches beside Henry enjoying the delicious odor in\\r\\nanticipation of the more solid delights of breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had hard crackers and with these, and drinking the coffee from\\r\\nthe kettle itself, when it was cool enough, the two boys feasted like\\r\\nmonarchs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jo!\" exclaimed Henry. \"This beats maw\\'s soda biscuit and fat meat\\r\\ngravy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as he ate, Hiram\\'s gaze traveled again and again across the\\r\\nscrub-grown meadow. The lay of the land pleased him. The richness of the\\r\\nsoil had been revealed when they dug the earthworm.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor thousands of years the riches of yonder hillside had been washing\\r\\ndown upon the bottom, and this alluvial was rich beyond computation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere were several acres, the young farmer knew, which, however\\r\\nover-cropped the remainder of Uncle Jeptha\\'s land had been, could not be\\r\\nimpoverished in many seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s as rich as cream!\" muttered he, thoughtfully. \"Grubbing out these\\r\\nyoung pines wouldn\\'t take long. There\\'s a heavy sod and it would have\\r\\nto be ploughed deeply. Then a crop of corn this year, perhaps--late corn\\r\\nfor fear the river might overflow it in June. And then----\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Great Scot!\" ejaculated Hiram, slapping his knee, \"what wouldn\\'t grow\\r\\non this bottom land?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it\\'s mighty rich,\" agreed Henry. \"But it\\'s a long way from the\\r\\nhouse--and then, the river might flood it over. I\\'ve seen water running\\r\\nover this bottom two feet deep--once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey finished the al fresco meal and Hiram leaped up, inspired by his\\r\\nthoughts to brisker movements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever else this old farm has on it, I vow and declare,\" he said,\\r\\n\"this five or six acres alone might be made to pay a profit on the whole\\r\\ninvestment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX. THE BARGAIN IS MADE\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry showed Hiram the \"branch\", a little stream flowing into the river,\\r\\nwhich marked the westerly boundary of the farm for some ways, and they\\r\\nset off up the steep bank of this stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis back end of the farm--quite forty acres, or half of the whole\\r\\ntract--had been entirely neglected by the last owner of the property for\\r\\na great many years. It was some distance from the house, for the farm\\r\\nwas a long and narrow strip of land from the highway to the river, and\\r\\nUncle Jeptha had had quite all he could do to till the uplands and the\\r\\nfields adjacent to his home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came upon these open fields--many of them filthy with dead weeds\\r\\nand littered with sprouting bushes--from the rear. Hiram saw that the\\r\\nfences were in bad repair and that the back of the premises gave every\\r\\nindication of neglect and shiftlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps not exactly the latter; Uncle Jeptha had been an old man and\\r\\nunable to do much active work for some years. But he had cropped certain\\r\\nof his fields \"on shares\" with the usual results--impoverished soil,\\r\\nilly-tilled crops, and the land left in a slovenly condition which\\r\\nseveral years of careful tillage would hardly overcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, although Hiram\\'s father had been of the tenant class, he had farmed\\r\\nother men\\'s land as he would his own. Owners of outlying farms had been\\r\\nglad to get Mr. Strong to till their fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had known how to work, he knew the reasons for every bit of labor\\r\\nhe performed, and he had not kept his son in ignorance of them. As they\\r\\nworked together the father had explained to the son what he did, and why\\r\\nhe did it, The results of their work spoke for themselves, and Hiram had\\r\\na retentive memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Strong, too, had been a great, reader--especially in the winter when\\r\\nthe farmer naturally has more time in-doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet he was a \"twelve months farmer\"; he knew that the winter, despite\\r\\nthe broken nature of the work, was quite as valuable to the successful\\r\\nfarmer as the other seasons of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elder Strong knew that men with more money, and more time for\\r\\nexperimenting than he had, were writing and publishing all the time\\r\\nhelps for the wise farmer. He subscribed for several papers, and read\\r\\nand digested them carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram, even during his two years in the city, had continued his\\r\\nsubscription (although it was hard to find the money sometimes) to two\\r\\nor three of those publications that his father had most approved. And\\r\\nthe boy had read them faithfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was as up-to-date in farming lore now, if not in actual practise, as\\r\\nhe had been when he left the country to try his fortune in Crawberry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the place where the branch turned back upon itself and hid its\\r\\nsource in the thicker timber, Hiram saw that the fields were open on\\r\\nboth sides of this westerly line of the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s our neighbor over yonder, Henry?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dickerson--Sam Dickerson,\" said Henry. \"And he\\'s got a boy, Pete, no\\r\\nolder than us. Say, Hiram, you\\'ll have trouble with Pete Dickerson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I guess not,\" returned the young farmer, laughing. \"Trouble is\\r\\nsomething that I don\\'t go about hunting for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t have to hunt it when Pete is round,\" said Henry with a wry\\r\\ngrin. \"But mebbe he won\\'t bother you, for he\\'s workin\\' near town--for\\r\\nthat new man that\\'s moved into the old Fleigler place. Bronson\\'s his\\r\\nname. But if Pete don\\'t bother you, Sam may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sam\\'s the father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yep. And one poor farmer and mean man, if ever there was one! Oh, Pete\\r\\ncomes by his orneriness honestly enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I hope I\\'ll have no trouble with any neighbor,\" said Hiram,\\r\\nhopefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came briskly to the outbuildings belonging to Mrs. Atterson\\'s newly\\r\\nacquired legacy. Hiram glanced into the hog lot. She looked like a good\\r\\nsow, and the six-weeks-old shoats were in good condition. In a couple of\\r\\nweeks they would be big enough to sell if Mrs. Atterson did not care to\\r\\nraise them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shoats were worth six dollars a pair, too; he had inquired the day\\r\\nbefore about them. There was practically eighteen dollars squealing in\\r\\nthat pen--and eighteen dollars would go a long way toward feeding the\\r\\nhorse and cow until there was good pasturage for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese animals named were in the small fenced barnyard. In the fall and\\r\\nwinter the old man had fed a good deal of fodder and other roughage, and\\r\\nduring the winter the horse and cow had tramped this coarse material,\\r\\nand the stable scrapings, into a mat of fairly good manure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked the horse and cow over with more care. It was a fact that\\r\\nthe horse looked pretty shaggy; but he had been used little during\\r\\nthe winter, and had been seldom curried. A ragged coat upon a horse\\r\\nsometimes covers quite as many good points as the same quality of\\r\\ngarment does upon a man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Hiram spoke to the beast it came to the fence with a friendly\\r\\nforward thrust of its ears, and the confidence of a horse that has been\\r\\nkindly treated and looks upon even a strange human as a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a strong and well-shaped animal, more than twelve years old,\\r\\nas Hiram discovered when he opened the creature\\'s mouth, but seemingly\\r\\nsound in limb. Nor was he too large for work on the cultivator, while\\r\\nsturdy enough to carry a single plow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram passed him over with a satisfactory pat on the nose and turned\\r\\nto look at the white-faced cow that had so terrified Mrs. Atterson. She\\r\\nwasn\\'t a bad looking beast, either, and would freshen shortly. Her calf\\r\\nwould be worth from twelve to fifteen dollars if Mrs. Atterson did not\\r\\nwish to raise it. Another future asset to mention to the old lady when\\r\\nhe returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth turned his attention to the buildings themselves--the barn,\\r\\nthe cart shed, the henhouse, and the smaller buildings. That famous old\\r\\ndecorating firm of Wind & Weather had contracted for all painting done\\r\\naround the Atterson place for the many years; but the buildings were not\\r\\notherwise in a bad state of repair.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few shingles had been blown off the roofs; here and there a board was\\r\\nloose. With a hammer and a few nails, and in a few hours, many of these\\r\\nsmall repairs could be accomplished. And a coat or two of properly\\r\\nmixed and applied whitewash would freshen up the whole place and--like\\r\\ncharity--cover a multitude of sins.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry bade him good-bye now, they shook hands, and Hiram agreed to let\\r\\nhis new friend know at once if he decided to come with Mrs. Atterson to\\r\\nthe farm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can have heaps of fun--you and me,\" declared Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It isn\\'t so bad,\" soliloquized the young farmer when he was alone.\\r\\n\"There\\'d be time to put the buildings and fences in good shape before\\r\\nthe spring work came on with a rush. There\\'s fertilizer enough in the\\r\\nbarnyard and the pig pen and the hen run--with the help of a few pounds\\r\\nof salts and some bone meal, perhaps--to enrich a right smart kitchen\\r\\ngarden and spread for corn on that four acre lot yonder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, this land up here on the hill needs humus. If it has been\\r\\ncropped on shares, as Henry says, all the enrichment it has received\\r\\nhas been from commercial fertilizers. And necessarily they have made the\\r\\nland sour. It probably needs lime badly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I can\\'t encourage Mrs. Atterson to look for a profit in anything\\r\\nthis year. It will take a year to get that rich bottom into shape\\r\\nfor--for what, I wonder? Onions? Celery? It would raise \\'em both. I\\'ll\\r\\nthink about that and look over the market prospects more fully before I\\r\\ndecide.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor already, you see, Hiram had come to the decision that this old farm\\r\\ncould be made to pay. Why not? The true farmer has to have imagination\\r\\nas well as the knowledge and the perseverance to grow crops. He must be\\r\\nable in his mind\\'s eye to see a field ready for the reaping before he\\r\\nputs in a seed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not go to the house on this occasion, but after casually\\r\\nexamining the tools and harness, and the like, left by the old man, he\\r\\ncut off across the upper end of the farm and gave the neglected open\\r\\nfields of this upper forty a casual examination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If she had the money to invest, I\\'d say buy sheep and fence these\\r\\nfields and so get rid of the weeds. They\\'ve grown very foul through\\r\\nneglect, and cultivating them for years would not destroy the weeds as\\r\\nsheep would in two seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But wire fencing is expensive--and so are good sheep to begin with. No.\\r\\nSlow but sure must be our motto. I mustn\\'t advise any great outlay of\\r\\nmoney--that would scare her to death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be hard enough for her to put out money all season long before\\r\\nthere are any returns. We\\'ll go, slow,\" repeated Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he left the farm that afternoon he went swiftly enough to\\r\\nScoville and took the train for the not far distant city of Crawberry.\\r\\nThis was Tuesday evening and he arrived just about supper time at Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for Hiram\\'s absence, and the matter of Mrs. Atterson\\'s legacy\\r\\naltogether, had been kept from the boarders. And there was no time until\\r\\nafter the principal meal of the day was off the lady\\'s mind for Hiram to\\r\\nsay anything to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She\\'s a good old soul,\" thought Hiram. \"And if it\\'s in my power to make\\r\\nthat farm pay, and yield her a competency for her old age, I\\'ll do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile he was not losing sight of the fact that there was something\\r\\ndue to him in this matter. He was bound to see that he got his\\r\\nshare--and a just share--of any profits that might accrue from the\\r\\nventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, after the other boarders had scattered, and Mrs. Atterson had eaten\\r\\nher own late supper, and Sister was swashing plates and knives and forks\\r\\nabout in a big pan of hot water in the kitchen sink, (between whiles\\r\\ndoing her best to listen at the crack of the door) the landlady and\\r\\nHiram Strong threshed out the project fully.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not all one-sided; for Mrs. Atterson, after all, had been\\r\\nbargaining all her life and could see the \"main chance\" as quickly as\\r\\nthe next one. She had not bickered with hucksters, chivvied grocerymen,\\r\\nfought battles royal with butchers, and endured the existence of a Red\\r\\nIndian amidst allied foes for two decades without having her wits ground\\r\\nto a razor edge.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, Hiram Strong, although a boy in years, had been his\\r\\nown master long enough to take care of himself in most transactions, and\\r\\nwithal had a fund of native caution. They jotted down memoranda of the\\r\\npoints on which they were agreed, which included the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson, as \"party of the first part\", agreed to board Hiram until\\r\\nthe crops were harvested the second year. In addition she was to pay\\r\\nhim one hundred dollars at Christmas time this first year, and another\\r\\nhundred at the conclusion of the agreement--i. e., when the second\\r\\nyear\\'s crop was harvested.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside, of the estimated profits of the second year\\'s crop, Hiram was\\r\\nto have twenty-five per cent. This profit was to be that balance in the\\r\\nfarm\\'s favor (if such balance there was) over and above the actual cost\\r\\nof labor, seed, and such purchased fertilizer or other supplies as were\\r\\nnecessary. Mrs. Atterson agreed likewise to supply one serviceable horse\\r\\nand such tools as might be needed, for the place was to be run as \"a\\r\\none-horse farm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand Hiram agreed to give his entire time to the farm, to\\r\\nwork for Mrs. Atterson\\'s interest in all things, to make no expenditures\\r\\nwithout discussing them first with her, and to give his best care and\\r\\nattention generally to the farm and all that pertained thereto. Of\\r\\ncourse, the old lady was taking Hiram a good deal on trust. But she had\\r\\nknown the boy almost two years and he had been faithful and prompt in\\r\\ndischarging his debts to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was up to the young fellow to \"make good.\" He could not expect\\r\\nto make any profit for his employer the first year; but he would be\\r\\nexpected to do so the second season, or \"show cause.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen these matters were all discussed and the little memorandum\\r\\nsigned, Hiram Strong, in his own room, thought the situation over very\\r\\nseriously. He was facing the biggest responsibility that he had obliged\\r\\nto assume in his whole life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was no boyish job; it was man\\'s work. He had put his hand to an\\r\\nagreement that might influence his whole future, and certainly would\\r\\nmake or break his credit as a trustworthy youth and one of his word.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these past days Hiram had determined to \"get back to the soil\"\\r\\nand to get back to it in a business-like way. He desired to make good\\r\\nfor Mrs. Atterson so that he might some time have the chance to make\\r\\ngood for somebody else on a bigger scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not propose to be \"a one-horse farmer\" all his days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X. THE SOUND OF BEATING HOOFS\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday morning Mrs. Atterson put her house in the agent\\'s hands. On\\r\\nWednesday a pair of spinster ladies came to look at it. They came again\\r\\non Thursday and again on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday being considered an \"unlucky\" day they did not bind the bargain;\\r\\nbut on Saturday money was passed, and the new keepers of the house were\\r\\nto take possession in a week. Not until then were the boarders informed\\r\\nof Mother Atterson\\'s change of circumstances, and the fact that she was\\r\\ngoing to graduate from the boarding house kitchen to the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, they were sorry--those light-headed, irresponsible young\\r\\nmen. There wasn\\'t one of them, from Crackit down the line, who could\\r\\nnot easily remember some special kindness that marked the old lady\\'s\\r\\nintercourse with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the fact was announced that the boarding house had changed\\r\\nhands, the boarders were up in arms. There was a wild gabble of voices,\\r\\nover the supper table that night. Crackit led the chorus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a mean trick. Mother Atterson has sold us like so many cattle to\\r\\nthe highest bidder. Ungrateful--right down ungrateful, I call it,\" he\\r\\ndeclared. \"What do you say, Feeble?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is particularly distasteful to me just now,\" complained the invalid.\\r\\n\"When Sister has learned to give me my hot water at just the right\\r\\ntemperature,\" and he took a sip of that innocent beverage. \"Don\\'t you\\r\\nsuppose we could prevail upon the old lady to renig?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She\\'s bound to put us off with half rations for the rest of the time\\r\\nshe stays,\" declared Crackit, shaking his head wisely. \"She\\'s got\\r\\nnothing to lose now. She don\\'t care if we all up and leave--after she\\r\\ngets hers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s always the way,\" feebly remarked Mr. Peebles. \"Just as soon as I\\r\\nreally get settled down into a half-decent lodging, something happens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Peebles had been a fixture at Mother Atterson\\'s for nearly ten\\r\\nyears. Only Old Lem Camp had been longer at the place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter was the only boarder who had no adverse criticism for the\\r\\nmistress\\'s new move. Indeed this evening Mr. Camp said nothing whatever;\\r\\neven his usual mumblings to himself were not heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate slowly, and but little. He was still sitting at the table when\\r\\nall the others had departed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson started into the dining-room with her own supper between\\r\\ntwo plates when she saw the old man sitting there despondent in looks\\r\\nand attitude, his head resting on one clawlike hand, his elbow on the\\r\\nsoiled table cloth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not look up, nor move. The mistress glanced back over her\\r\\nshoulder, and there was Sister, sniffling and occasionally rubbing her\\r\\nwrist into her red eyes as she scraped the tower of plates from the\\r\\ndinner table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My soul and body!\" gasped Mother Atterson, almost dropping her supper\\r\\non the floor. \"There\\'s Sister--and there\\'s Old Lem Camp! Whatever will I\\r\\ndo with \\'em?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Hiram Strong had already left for the farm on the Wednesday\\r\\nprevious. The other boarders knew nothing about his agreement with\\r\\nMother Atterson; he had agreed to go to the place and begin work, and\\r\\ntake care of the stock and all, \"choring for himself\", as the good lady\\r\\ncalled it, until she could complete her city affairs and move herself\\r\\nand her personal chattels to the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram bore a note to the woman who had promised to care for the Atterson\\r\\nplace, and money to pay her what the boarding-house mistress had agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can \\'bach\\' it in the house as well as poor old Uncle Jeptha did, I\\r\\nreckon,\" this woman told the youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe showed him where certain provisions were--the pork barrel, ham and\\r\\nbacon of the old man\\'s curing, and the few vegetables remaining from the\\r\\nwinter\\'s store.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The cow was about gone dry, anyway,\" said the woman, Mrs. Larriper, who\\r\\nwas a widow and lived with her married daughter some half-mile down the\\r\\nroad toward Scoville, \"so I didn\\'t bother to milk her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll have to go to town to buy grain, if you want to feed her up--and\\r\\nfor the chickens and the horse. The old man didn\\'t make much of a crop\\r\\nlast year--or them shiftless Dickersons didn\\'t make much for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw Sam Dickerson around here this morning. He borrowed some of the\\r\\nold man\\'s tools when Uncle Jeptha was sick, and you\\'ll have to go after\\r\\n\\'em, I reckon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sam\\'s the best borrower that ever was; but he never can remember to\\r\\nbring things back. He says it\\'s bad enough to have to borrow; it\\'s too\\r\\nmuch to expect the same man to return what he borrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Mrs. Dickerson,\" pursued Mrs. Larriper, \"was as nice a girl before\\r\\nshe married--she was a Stepney--as ever walked in shoe-leather. And I\\r\\nguess she\\'d be right friendly with the neighbors if Sam would let her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the poor thing never gits to go out--no, sir! She\\'s jest tied to\\r\\nthe house. They lost a child once--four year ago. That\\'s the only time\\r\\nI remember of seeing Sarah Stepney in church since the day she was\\r\\nmarried--and she\\'s got a boy--Pete--as old as you be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, on the other side o\\' ye there\\'s Darrell\\'s tract, and you won\\'t\\r\\nhave no trouble there, for there ain\\'t a house on his place, and he lets\\r\\nit lie idle. Waiting for a rise in price, I \\'spect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some rich folks is comin\\' in and buying up pieces of land and making\\r\\nwhat they calls \\'gentlemen\\'s estates\\' out o\\' them. A family named\\r\\nBronson--Mr. Stephen Bronson, with one little girl--bought the Fleigler\\r\\nplace only last month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'re nice folks,\" pursued this amiable but talkative lady, \"and\\r\\nthey don\\'t live but a mile or so along the Scoville road. You passed the\\r\\nplace--white, with green shutters, and a water-tower in the back, when\\r\\nyou walked up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember it,\" said Hiram, nodding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'re western folk. Come clear from out in Injiany, or Illiny, or\\r\\nthe like. The girl\\'s going to school and she ain\\'t got no mother, so her\\r\\nfather\\'s come on East with her to be near the school.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I can\\'t help you no more. Them hens! Well, I\\'d sell \\'em if I was\\r\\nMis\\' Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hens ain\\'t much nowadays, anyhow; and I expect a good many of those are\\r\\ntoo old to lay. Uncle Jeptha couldn\\'t fuss with chickens, and he didn\\'t\\r\\nraise only a smitch of \\'em last year and the year before--just them that\\r\\nthe hens hatched themselves in stolen nests, and chanced to bring up\\r\\nalive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You better grease the cart before you use it. It\\'s stood since they\\r\\nhauled in corn last fall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And look out for Dickerson. Ask him for the things he borrowed. You\\'ll\\r\\nneed \\'em, p\\'r\\'aps, if you\\'re goin\\' to do any farmin\\' for Mis\\' Atterson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bustled away. Hiram thought he had heard enough about his neighbors\\r\\nfor a while, and he went out to look over the pasture fencing, which was\\r\\nto be his first repair job. He would have that ready to turn the cow and\\r\\nher calf into as soon as the grass began to grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rummaged about in what had been half woodshed and half workshop\\r\\nin Uncle Jeptha\\'s time, and found a heavy claw-hammer, a pair of wire\\r\\ncutters, and a pocket full of fence staples.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this outfit he prepared to follow the line fence, which was\\r\\nlikewise the pasture fence on the west side, between Mrs. Atterson\\'s and\\r\\nDickerson\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere he could, he mended the broken strands of wire. In other places\\r\\nthe wires had sagged and were loose. The claw-hammer fixed these like\\r\\na charm. Slipping the wire into the claw, a single twist of the wrist\\r\\nwould usually pick up the sag and make the wire taut again at that\\r\\npoint.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drove a few staples, as needed, as he walked along. The pasture\\r\\npartook of the general conformation of the farm--it was rather long and\\r\\nnarrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had grown to clumps of bushes in spots, and there was sufficient\\r\\nshade. But he did not come to the water until he reached the lower end\\r\\nof the lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe branch trickled from a spring, or springs, farther east. It made\\r\\nan elbow at the corner of the pasture--the lower south-west corner--and\\r\\nthere a water-hole had been scooped out at some past time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis waterhole was deep enough for all purposes, and was shaded by a\\r\\ngreat oak that had stood there long before the house belonging to Jeptha\\r\\nAtterson had been built.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Hiram struck something that puzzled him. The boundary fence crossed\\r\\nthis water-hole at a tangent, and recrossed to the west bank of the\\r\\noutflowing branch a few yards below, leaving perhaps half of the\\r\\nwater-hole upon the neighbor\\'s side of the fence.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of this wire at the water-hole was practically new. So were the\\r\\nposts. And after a little Hiram traced the line of old postholes which\\r\\nhad followed a straight line on the west side of the water-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, this water-privilege for Dickerson\\'s land was of recent\\r\\narrangement--so recent indeed, that the young farmer believed he could\\r\\nsee some fresh-turned earth about the newly-set posts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s something to be looked into, I am afraid,\" thought Hiram, as he\\r\\nmoved along the southern pasture fence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the trickle of the branch beckoned him; he had not found the\\r\\nfountain-head of the little stream when he had walked over a part of the\\r\\ntimbered land with Henry Pollock, and now he struck into the open woods\\r\\nagain, digging into the soil here and there with his heavy boot, marking\\r\\nthe quality and age of the timber, and casting-up in his mind the\\r\\npossibilities and expense of clearing these overgrown acres.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Atterson may have a very valuable piece of land here in time,\"\\r\\nmuttered Hiram. \"A sawmill set up in here could cut many a hundred\\r\\nthousand feet of lumber--and good lumber, too. But it would spoil the\\r\\nbeauty of the farm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, as must ever be in the case of the utility farm, the house was\\r\\nset on its ugliest part. The cleared fields along the road had nothing\\r\\nbut the background of woods on the south and east to relieve their\\r\\nmonotony.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the brow of the steeper descent, which he had noted on his former\\r\\nvisit to the back end of the farm, he found a certain clearing in the\\r\\nwood. Here the pines surrounded the opening on three sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the south, through a break in the wooded hillside, he obtained a\\r\\nfar-reaching view of the river valley as it lay, to the east and to the\\r\\nwest. The prospect was delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere and there, on the farther bank of the river, which rose less\\r\\nabruptly there than on this side, lay several cheerful looking\\r\\nfarmsteads. The white dwellings and outbuildings dotted the checkered\\r\\nfields of green and brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nCowbells tinkled in the distance, for the weather tempted farmers to let\\r\\ntheir cattle run in the pastures even so early in the season. A horse\\r\\nwhinnied shrilly to a mate in a distant field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creaking of the heavy wheels of a laden farm-cart was a mellow sound\\r\\nin Hiram\\'s ears. Beyond a fir plantation, high on the hillside, the\\r\\nsharply outlined steeple of a little church lay against the soft blue\\r\\nhorizon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A beauty-spot!\" Hiram muttered. \"What a site for a home! And yet people\\r\\nwant to build their houses right on an automobile road, and in sight of\\r\\nthe rural mail box!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis imagination began to riot, spurred by the outlook and by the nearer\\r\\nprospect of wood and hillside. The sun now lay warmly upon him as he sat\\r\\nupon a stump and drank in the beauty of it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time his ear, becoming attuned to the multitudinous voices\\r\\nof the wood, descried the silvery note of falling water. He arose and\\r\\ntraced the sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess than twenty yards away, and not far from the bluff, a vigorous\\r\\nrivulet started from beneath the half-bared roots of a monster beech,\\r\\nand fell over an outcropping boulder into a pool so clear that sand\\r\\non its bottom, worked mysteriously into a pattern by the action of the\\r\\nwater, lay revealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram knelt on a mossy rock beside the pool, and bending put his lips\\r\\nto the water. It was the sweetest, most satisfying drink, he had imbibed\\r\\nfor many a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the morning was growing old, and Hiram wanted to trace the farther\\r\\nline of the farm. He went down to the river, crossed the open meadow\\r\\nagain where they had built the campfire the morning before, and found\\r\\nthe deeply scarred oak which stood exactly on the boundary line between\\r\\nthe Atterson and Darrell tracts.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to the north, and followed the line as nearly as might be. The\\r\\nDarrell tract was entirely wooded, and when he reached the uplands\\r\\nhe kept on in the shadowy aisles of the sap-pines which covered his\\r\\nneighbor\\'s property.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came finally to where the ground fell away again, and the yellow,\\r\\ndeeply-rutted road lay at his feet. The winter had played havoc with the\\r\\nautomobile track.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highway was unfenced and the bank dropped fifteen feet to the beaten\\r\\npath. A leaning oak overhung the road and Hiram lingered here, lying\\r\\non its broad trunk, face upward, with his hat pulled over his eyes to\\r\\nshield them from the sunlight which filtered through the branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis land hereabout was beautiful. The boy could appreciate the beauty\\r\\nas well as the utility of the soil. It was so pleasing to the eye that\\r\\nhe wished with all his heart it had been his own land he had surveyed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I\\'ll not be a tenant farmer all my life, nor a farm-foreman, as\\r\\nfather was,\" determined the boy. \"I\\'ll get ahead. If I work for the\\r\\nbenefit of other people for a few years, surely I\\'ll win the chance in\\r\\ntime to at last work for myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of his ruminations a sound broke upon his ear--a jarring\\r\\nnote in the peaceful murmur of the woodland life. It was the thud of a\\r\\nhorse\\'s hoofs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot the sedate tunk-tunk of iron-shod feet on the damp earth, but\\r\\nan erratic and rapid pounding of hoof-beats which came on with such\\r\\nstartling swiftness that Hiram sat up instantly, and craned his neck to\\r\\nsee up the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That horse is running away!\" gasped the young farmer, and he swung\\r\\nhimself out upon the lowest branch of the leaning tree which overhung\\r\\nthe carttrack, the better to see along the highway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI. A GIRL RIDES INTO THE TALE\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no bend in the highway for some distance, but the overhanging\\r\\ntrees masked the track completely, save for a few hundred yards. The\\r\\nhorse, whether driven or running at large, was plainly spurred by\\r\\nfright.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto the peacefulness of this place its hoof-beats were bringing the\\r\\nelement of peril.\\r\\n\\r\\nLying prostrate on the sloping trunk, Hiram could see much farther up\\r\\nthe road. The outstretched head and lathered breast of a tall bay horse\\r\\nleaped into view, and like a picture in a kinetoscope, growing larger\\r\\nand more vivid second by second, the maddened animal came down the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram could see that the beast was not riderless, but it was a moment\\r\\nor two--a long-drawn, anxious space of heart-beaten seconds--ere he\\r\\nrealized what manner of rider it was who clung so desperately to the\\r\\nmasterless creature.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a girl--a little girl!\" gasped Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was only a speck of color, with white, drawn face, on the back of\\r\\nthe racing horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery plunge of the oncoming animal shook the little figure as though\\r\\nit must fall from the saddle. But Hiram could see that she hung with\\r\\nphenomenal pluck to the broken bridle and to the single horn of her\\r\\nside-saddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the horse fell, or if she were shaken free, she would be flung to\\r\\ninstant death, or be fearfully bruised under the pounding hoofs of the\\r\\nbig horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young farmer\\'s appreciation of the peril was instant; unused as he\\r\\nwas to meeting such emergency, there was neither panic nor hesitancy in\\r\\nhis actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe writhed farther out upon the limb of the leaning oak until he was\\r\\ndirect above the road. The big bay naturally kept to the middle, for\\r\\nthere was no obstruction in its path.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo have dropped to the highway would have put Hiram to instant\\r\\ndisadvantage; for before he could have recovered himself after the drop\\r\\nthe horse would have been upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, swinging with both legs wrapped around the tough limb, and his left\\r\\nhand gripping a smaller branch, but with his back to the plunging brute,\\r\\nthe youth glanced under his right armpit to judge the distance and the\\r\\non-rush of the horse and its helpless rider.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew she saw him. Swift as was the steed\\'s approach, Hiram had seen\\r\\nthe change come into the expression of the girl\\'s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Clear your foot of the stirrup!\" he shouted, hoping the girl would\\r\\nunderstand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a confusing thunder of hoofbeats the bay came on--was beneath\\r\\nhim--had passed!\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram\\'s right arm shot out, curved slightly, and as his fingers gripped\\r\\nher sleeve, the girl let go. She was whisked out of the saddle and the\\r\\nhorse swept on without her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strain of the girl\\'s slight weight upon his arm lasted but a moment,\\r\\nfor Hiram let go with his feet, swung down, and dropped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey alighted in the roadway with so slight a jar that he scarcely\\r\\nstaggered, but set the girl down gently, and for the passing of a breath\\r\\nher body swayed against him, seeking support.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she sprang a little away, and they stood looking at each\\r\\nother--Hiram panting and flushed, the girl with wide-open eyes out of\\r\\nwhich the terror had not yet faded, and cheeks still colorless.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they stood, for fully half a minute, speechless, while the thunder of\\r\\nthe bay\\'s hoofs passed further and further away and finally was lost in\\r\\nthe distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it wasn\\'t excitement that kept the boy dumb; for that was all over,\\r\\nand he had been as cool as need be through the incident. But it\\r\\nwas unbounded amazement that made him stare so at the slight girl\\r\\nconfronting him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had seen her brilliant, dark little face before. Only once--but that\\r\\none occasion had served to photograph her features on his memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the second time he had been of service to her; but he knew\\r\\ninstantly--and the fact did not puzzle him--that she did not recognize\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been so dark in the unlighted side street back in Crawberry the\\r\\nevening of their first meeting that Hiram believed (and was glad) that\\r\\nneither she nor her father would recognize him as the boy who had kept\\r\\ntheir carriage from going into the open ditch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he had played rescuer again--and in a much more heroic manner.\\r\\nThis was the daughter of the man whom he had thought to be a prosperous\\r\\nfarmer, and whose card Hiram had lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hoped the gentleman might have a job for him; but now Hiram was\\r\\nnot looking for a job. He had given himself heartily to the project of\\r\\nmaking the old Atterson farm pay; nor was he the sort of fellow to show\\r\\nfickleness in such a project.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore either Hiram or the girl broke the silence--before that silence\\r\\ncould become awkward, indeed--there started into hearing the ring of\\r\\nrapid hoofbeats again. But it was not the runaway returning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mate of the latter appeared, and he came jogging along the road,\\r\\nvery much in hand, the rider seemingly quite unflurried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a big, ungainly, beak-nosed boy, whose sleeves were much too\\r\\nshort, and trousers-legs likewise, to hide Nature\\'s abundant gift to him\\r\\nin the matter of bone and knuckle. He was freckled and wore a grin that\\r\\nwas not even sheepish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow, this stolidity and inappreciation of the peril the girl had so\\r\\nrecently escaped, made Hiram feel sudden indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the girl herself took the lout to task--before Hiram could say a\\r\\nword.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you that horse could not bear the whip, Peter!\" she exclaimed,\\r\\nwith wrathful gaze. \"How dared you strike him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aw--I only touched him up a bit,\" drawled the youth. \"You said you\\r\\ncould ride anything, didn\\'t you?\" and his grin grew wider. \"But I see ye\\r\\nhad to get off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Hiram could stand it no longer, and he blurted out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She might have been killed! I believe that horse is running yet----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, why didn\\'t you stop it?\" demanded the other youth, \"impudently.\\r\\nYou had a chance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He saved me,\" cried the girl, looking at Hiram now with shining eyes.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know how to thank him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He might have stopped the horse while he was about it,\" growled the\\r\\nfellow, picking up his own reins again. \"Now I\\'ll have to ride after\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'d better,\" said the little lady, sharply. \"If father knew that\\r\\nhorse had run away with me he would be dreadfully put out. You hurry\\r\\nafter him, Peter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lout never said a word in reply, but his horse carried him swiftly\\r\\nout of sight in the wake of the runaway. Then the girl turned again to\\r\\nHiram and the young farmer knew that he was being keenly examined by her\\r\\nbright black eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sure father will not keep him,\" declared the girl, looking at\\r\\nHiram thoughtfully. \"He is too careless--and I don\\'t like him, anyway.\\r\\nDo you live around here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I expect to,\" replied Hiram, smiling. \"I have just come. I am going to\\r\\nstay at this next house, along the road.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! where the old gentleman died last week?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. Mrs. Atterson was left the place by her uncle, and I am going to\\r\\nrun it for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear! then you\\'ve got a place to work?\" queried the little lady,\\r\\nwith plain disappointment in her tone. \"I am sure father would like to\\r\\nhave you instead of Peter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram shook his head slowly, though still smiling,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m obliged to you,\" he said; \"but I have agreed to stop with Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson for a time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want father to meet you just the same,\" she declared.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a way about her that impressed Hiram with the idea that she\\r\\nseldom failed in getting what she wanted. If she was not a spoiled\\r\\nchild, she certainly was a very much indulged one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she was pretty! Dark, petite, with a brilliant smile, flashing\\r\\neyes, and a riot of blue-black curls, she was verily the daintiest and\\r\\nprettiest little creature the young farmer had ever seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Lettie Bronson,\" she said, frankly. \"I live down the road toward\\r\\nScoville. We have only just come here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know where you live,\" said Hiram, smiling and nodding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must come and see us. I want you to know father. He\\'s the very\\r\\nnicest man there is, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He came all the way East here so as to live near my school--I go to the\\r\\nSt. Beris school in Scoville. It\\'s awfully nice, and the girls are very\\r\\nfashionable; but I\\'d be too lonely to live if daddy wasn\\'t right near me\\r\\nall the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is your name?\" she asked suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram told her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why! that\\'s a regular farmer\\'s name, isn\\'t it--Hiram?\" and she\\r\\nlaughed--a clear and sweet sound, that made an inquisitive squirrel that\\r\\nhad been watching them scamper away to his hollow, chattering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know about that,\" returned the young farmer, shaking his\\r\\nhead and smiling. \"I ought by good rights to be \\'a worker in brass\\',\\r\\naccording to the Bible. That was the trade of Hiram, of the tribe of\\r\\nNaphtali, who came out of Tyre to make all the brass work for Solomon\\'s\\r\\ntemple.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! and there was a King Hiram, of Tyre, too, wasn\\'t there,\" cried\\r\\nLettie, laughing. \"You might be a king, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That seems to be an unprofitable trade now-a-days,\" returned the young\\r\\nfellow, shaking his head. \"I think I will be the namesake of Hiram, the\\r\\nbrass-smith, for it is said of him that he was \\'filled with wisdom and\\r\\nunderstanding\\' and that is what I want to be if I am going to run Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson\\'s farm and make it pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a funny boy,\" said the girl, eyeing him furiously.\\r\\n\"You\\'re--you\\'re not at all like Pete--or these other boys about\\r\\nScoville.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that Pete Dickerson isn\\'t any good at all! I shall tell daddy all\\r\\nabout how he touched up that horse and made him run. Here he comes now!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had been walking steadily along the road toward the Atterson house,\\r\\nand in the direction the runaway had taken. Pete Dickerson appeared,\\r\\nriding one of the bays and leading the one that had been frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter was all of a lather, was blowing hard, and before the horses\\r\\nreached them, Hiram saw that the runaway was in bad shape.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold on!\" he cried to the lout. \"Breathe that horse a while. Let him\\r\\nstand. He ought to be rubbed down, too. Don\\'t you see the shape he is\\r\\nin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aw, what\\'s eatin\\' you?\" demanded Pete, eyeing the speaker with much\\r\\ndisfavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horse, when he stopped, was trembling all over. His nostrils were\\r\\ndilated and as red as blood, and strings of foam were dripping from his\\r\\nbit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t let him stand there in the shade,\" spoke Hiram, more \"mildly.\\r\\nHe\\'ll take a chill. Here! let me have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe approached the still frightened horse, and Pete jerked the\\r\\nbridle-rein. The horse started back and snorted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stand \\'round there, ye \\'tarnal nuisance!\" exclaimed Pete.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram caught the bridle and snatched it from the other fellow\\'s\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just let me manage him a minute,\" said Hiram, leading the horse into\\r\\nthe sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe patted him, and soothed him, and the horse ceased trembling and his\\r\\nears pricked up. Hiram, still keeping the reins in his hand, loosened\\r\\nthe cinches and eased the saddle so that the animal could breathe\\r\\nbetter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were bunches of dried sage-grass growing by the roadside, and the\\r\\nyoung farmer tore off a couple of these bunches and used them to wipe\\r\\ndown the horse\\'s legs. Pretty soon the creature forgot his fright and\\r\\nlooked like a normal horse again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he was mine I\\'d give him whip a-plenty--till he learned better,\"\\r\\ndrawled Pete Dickerson, finally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you ever dare touch him with the whip again!\" cried the girl,\\r\\nstamping her foot. \"He will not stand it. You were told----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aw, well,\" said the fellow, \"\\'I didn\\'t think he was going to cut up as\\r\\nbad as that. These Western horses ain\\'t more\\'n half broke, anyway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think he is perfectly safe for you to ride now, Miss Bronson,\" said\\r\\nHiram, quietly. \"I\\'ll give you a hand up. But walk him home, please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had tightened the cinches again. Lettie put her tiny booted foot in\\r\\nhis hand (she wore a very pretty dark green habit) and with perfect ease\\r\\nthe young farmer lifted her into the saddle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-bye--and thank you again!\" she said, softly, giving him her free\\r\\nhand just as the horse started.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say! you\\'re the fellow who\\'s going to live at Atterson\\'s place?\"\\r\\nobserved Pete. \"I\\'ll see you later,\" and he waved his hand airily as he\\r\\nrode off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that\\'s Pete Dickerson, is it?\" ruminated Hiram, as he watched the\\r\\nhorses out of sight. \"Well, if his father, Sam, is anything like him, we\\r\\ncertainly have got a sweet pair of neighbors!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII. SOMETHING ABOUT A PASTURE FENCE\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon Hiram hitched up the old horse and drove into town.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to see the lawyer who had transacted Uncle Jeptha Atterson\\'s\\r\\nsmall business in the old man\\'s lifetime, and had made his will--Mr.\\r\\nStrickland. Hiram judged that this gentleman would know as much about\\r\\nthe Atterson place as anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No--Mr. Atterson never said anything to me about giving a neighbor\\r\\nwater-rights,\" the lawyer said. \"Indeed, Mr. Atterson was not a man\\r\\nlikely to give anything away--until he had got through with it himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dickerson once tried to buy a right at that corner of the Atterson\\r\\npasture; but he and the old gentleman couldn\\'t come to terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dickerson has no water on his place, saving his well and his rights on\\r\\nthe river. It makes it bad for him, I suppose; but I do not advise Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson to let that fence stand. Give that sort of a man an inch and\\r\\nhe\\'ll take a mile.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what shall I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s professional advice, young man,\" returned the lawyer, \"smiling.\\r\\nBut I will give it to you without charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merely go and pull the new posts up and replace them on the line. If\\r\\nDickerson interferes with you, come to me and we\\'ll have him bound over\\r\\nbefore the Justice of the Peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You represent Mrs. Atterson and are within her rights. That\\'s the best\\r\\nI can tell you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Hiram was not desirous of starting any trouble--legal or\\r\\notherwise--with a neighbor; but neither did he wish to see anybody take\\r\\nadvantage of his old boarding mistress. He knew that, beside farming\\r\\nfor her, he would probably have to defend her from many petty annoyances\\r\\nlike the present case.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he bought the wire he needed for repairs, a few other things that\\r\\nwere necessary, and drove back to the farm, determined to go right ahead\\r\\nand await the consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong his purchases was an axe. In the workshop on the farm was a fairly\\r\\ngood grindstone; only the treadle was broken and Hiram had to repair\\r\\nthis before he could make much headway in grinding the axe. Henry\\r\\nPollock lived too far away to be called upon in such a small emergency.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing obliged to work alone sharpens one\\'s wits. The young farmer had to\\r\\nresort to shifts and expedients on every hand, as he went along.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day before, while wandering in the wood, he had marked several white\\r\\noaks of the right size for posts. He would have preferred cedars, of\\r\\ncourse; but those trees were scarce on the Atterson tract--and they\\r\\nmight be needed for some more important job later on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came up to the house at noon to feed the stock and make his own\\r\\nfrugal meal in the farm house kitchen, the posts were cut. After dinner\\r\\nhe harnessed the horse to the farm wagon, and went down for the posts,\\r\\ntaking the rolls of wire along to drop beside the fence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horse was a steady, willing creature, and seemed to have no tricks.\\r\\nHe did not drive very well on the road, of course; but that wasn\\'t what\\r\\nthey needed a horse for.\\r\\n\\r\\nDriving was a secondary matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram loaded his posts and hauled them to the pasture, driving inside\\r\\nthe fence line and dropping a post wherever one had rotted out.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet posts that had rotted at the ground were not so easy to draw out, as\\r\\nthe young farmer very well knew, and he set his wits to work to make the\\r\\nremoval of the old posts easy of accomplishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found an old, but strong, carpenter\\'s horse in the shed, to act as\\r\\na fulcrum, and a seasoned bar of hickory as a lever. There was never\\r\\nan old farm yet that didn\\'t have a useful heap of junk, and Hiram had\\r\\nalready scratched over Uncle Jeptha\\'s collection of many years\\' standng.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found what he sought in a wrought iron band some half inch in\\r\\nthickness with a heavy hook attached to it by a single strong link.\\r\\nHe fitted this band upon the larger end of the hickory bar, wedging it\\r\\ntightly into place.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short length of trace chain completed his simple post-puller. And he\\r\\ncould easily carry the outfit from place to place as it was needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he found a weak or rotting post, he pulled the staples that held\\r\\nthe strands of wire to it and and then set the trestle alongside the\\r\\npost. Resting the lever on the trestle, he dropped the end link of the\\r\\nchain on the hook, looped the chain around the post, and hooked on with\\r\\nanother link. Bearing down on the lever brought the post out of the\\r\\nground every time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a long-handled spade Hiram cleaned out the old holes, or enlarged\\r\\nthem, and set his new posts, one after the other. He left the wires to\\r\\nbe tightened and stapled later.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until the next afternoon that he worked down as far as the\\r\\nwater-hole. Meanwhile he had seen nothing of the neighbors and neither\\r\\nknew, nor cared, whether they were watching him or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was evident that the Dickersons had kept tabs on the young\\r\\nfarmer\\'s progress, for, he had no more than pulled the posts out of\\r\\nthe water-hole and started to reset them on the proper line, than the\\r\\nlong-legged Pete Dickerson appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hey, you!\" shouted Pete. \"What are you monkeying with that line fence\\r\\nfor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I won\\'t have time to fix it later,\" responded Hiram, calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fresh Ike, ain\\'t yer?\" demanded young Dickerson.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was half a head taller than Hiram, and plainly felt himself safe in\\r\\nadopting bullying tactics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You put them posts back where you found \\'em and string the wires again\\r\\nin a hurry--or I\\'ll make yer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is Mrs. Atterson\\'s fence,\" said Hiram, quietly. \"I have made\\r\\ninquiries about the line, and I know where it belongs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No part of this water-hole belongs on your side of the fence,\\r\\nDickerson, and as long as I represent Mrs. Atterson it\\'s not going to be\\r\\ngrabbed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say! the old man gave my father the right to a part of this hole long\\r\\nago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Show your legal paper to that effect,\" promptly suggested Hiram. \"Then\\r\\nwe will let it stand until the lawyers decide the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPete was silent for a minute; meanwhile Hiram continued to dig his hole,\\r\\nand finally set the first post into place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you to take that post out o\\' there, Mister,\" exclaimed Pete,\\r\\nsuddenly approaching the other. \"I don\\'t like you, anyway. You helped\\r\\ngit me turned off up there to Bronson\\'s yesterday. If you wouldn\\'t have\\r\\nput your fresh mouth in about the horse that gal wouldn\\'t have knowed\\r\\nso much to tell her father. Now you stop foolin\\' with this fence or I\\'ll\\r\\nlick you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram Strong\\'s disposition was far from being quarrelsome. He only\\r\\nlaughed at first and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, that won\\'t do you any good in the end, Peter. Thrashing me won\\'t\\r\\ngive you and your father the right to usurp rights at this water-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was very good reason, as I can see, for old Mr. Atterson refusing\\r\\nto let you water your stock here. In time of drouth the branch probably\\r\\nfurnished no more water than his own cattle needed. And it will be the\\r\\nsame with my employer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'d better have less talk about it, and set back them posts,\"\\r\\ndeclared Pete, decidedly, laying off his coat and pulling up his shirt\\r\\nsleeves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you won\\'t try anything foolish, Peter,\" said Hiram, resting on\\r\\nhis shovel handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Huh!\" grunted Pete, eyeing him sideways as might an evil-disposed dog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re not well matched,\" observed Hiram, quietly, \"and whether you\\r\\nthrashed me, or I thrashed you, nothing would be proved by it in regard\\r\\nto the line fence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll show you what I can prove!\" cried Pete, and rushed for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a catch-as-catch-can wrestle Pete Dickerson might have been able\\r\\nto overturn Hiram Strong. But the latter did not propose to give the\\r\\nlong-armed youth that advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dropped the spade, stepped nimbly aside, and as Pete lunged past\\r\\nhim the young farmer doubled his fist and struck his antagonist solidly\\r\\nunder the ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the only blow struck--that and the one when Pete struck the\\r\\nground. The bigger fellow rolled over, grunted, and gazed up at Hiram\\r\\nwith amazement struggling with the rage expressed in his features.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you we were not well matched, Peter,\" spoke Hiram, calmly. \"Why\\r\\nfight about it? You have no right on your side, and I do not propose to\\r\\nsee Mrs. Atterson robbed of this water privilege.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPete climbed to his feet slowly, and picked up his coat. He felt of his\\r\\nneck carefully and then looked at his hand, with the idea evidently that\\r\\nsuch a heavy blow must have brought blood. But of course there was none.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell my dad--that\\'s what I\\'ll do,\" ejaculated the bully, at\\r\\nlength, and he started immediately across the field, his long legs\\r\\nworking like a pair of tongs in his haste to get over the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram completed the setting of the posts at the water-hole without\\r\\nhearing further from any member of the Dickerson family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII. THE UPROOTING\\r\\n\\r\\nThese early Spring days were busy ones for Hiram Strong. The mornings\\r\\nwere frosty and he could not get to his fencing work until midforenoon.\\r\\nBut there were plenty of other tasks ready to his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two south windows in the farmhouse kitchen. He tried to keep\\r\\nsome fire in the stove there day and night, sleeping as he did in Uncle\\r\\nJeptha\\'s old bedroom nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore these two windows he erected wide shelves and on these he set\\r\\nshallow boxes of rich earth which he had prepared under the cart shed.\\r\\nThere was no frost under there, the earth was dry and the hens had\\r\\nscratched in it during the winter, so Hiram got all the well-sifted\\r\\nearth he needed for his seed boxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe used a very little commercial fertilizer in each box, and planted\\r\\nsome of the seeds he had bought in Crawberry at an agricultural\\r\\nwarehouse on Main Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson had expressed the hope that he would put in a variety of\\r\\nvegetables for their own use, and Hiram had followed her wishes. When\\r\\nthe earth in the boxes had warmed up for several days he put in the\\r\\nlong-germinating seeds, like tomato, onions, the salads, leek, celery,\\r\\npepper, eggplant, and some beet seed to transplant for the early garden.\\r\\nIt was too early yet to put in cabbage and cauliflower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese boxes caught the sun for a good part of the day. In the afternoon\\r\\nwhen the sun had gone, Hiram covered the boxes with old quilts and did\\r\\nnot uncover them again until the sun shone in the next morning. He had\\r\\ndecided to start his early plants in this way because he hadn\\'t the time\\r\\nat present to build frames outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early mornings and late afternoons, too, he began to make the\\r\\nsmall repairs around the house and outbuildings. Hiram was handy with\\r\\ntools; indeed, a true farmer should be a good mechanic as well. He must\\r\\noften combine carpentry and wheelwrighting and work at the forge, with\\r\\nhis agricultural pursuits. Hiram was something better than a \"cold-iron\\r\\nblacksmith.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it came to stretching the wire of the pasture fence he had to\\r\\nresort to his inventive powers. There are plenty of wire stretchers that\\r\\ncan be purchased; but they cost money.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young farmer knew that Mrs. Atterson had no money to waste, and he\\r\\nworked for her just as he would have worked for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne man working alone cannot easily stretch wire and make a good job\\r\\nof it without some mechanism to help him. Hiram\\'s was simple and easily\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nA twelve-inch section of perfectly round post, seven or eight inches\\r\\nthrough, served as the drum around which to wind the wire, and two\\r\\ntwenty-penny nails driven into the side of the drum, close together,\\r\\nwere sufficient to prevent the wire from slipping.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo either end of the drum Hiram passed two lengths of Number 9 wire\\r\\nthrough large screweyes, making a double loop into which the hook of a\\r\\nlight timber chain would easily catch. Into one end of the drum he drove\\r\\na headless spike, upon which the hand-crank of the grindstone fitted,\\r\\nand was wedged tight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn using this ingenious wire stretcher, he stapled his wire to post\\r\\nnumber one, carried the length past post number two, looped the chain\\r\\naround post number three, having the chain long enough so that he might\\r\\ntauten the wire and hold the crankhandle steady with his knee or left\\r\\narm while he drove the holding staple in post number two. And so repeat,\\r\\nad infinitum.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he had made this wire-stretcher the young fellow got along\\r\\nfamously upon his fencing and could soon turn his attention to other\\r\\nmatters, knowing that the cattle would be perfectly safe in the pasture\\r\\nfor the coming season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old posts he collected on the wagon and drew into the dooryard,\\r\\npiling them beside the woodshed. There was not an overabundant supply\\r\\nof firewood cut and Hiram realized that Mrs. Atterson would use\\r\\nconsiderable in her kitchen stove before the next winter, even if she\\r\\ndid not run a sitting room fire for long this spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing a bucksaw is not only a thankless job at any time, but it is no\\r\\nsaving of time or money. There was a good two-handed saw in the shed and\\r\\nHiram found a good rat-tail file. With the aid of a home-made saw-holder\\r\\nand a monkey wrench he sharpened and set this saw and then got Henry\\r\\nPollock to help him for a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry wasn\\'t afraid of work, and the two boys sawed and split the old\\r\\nand well-seasoned posts, and some other wood, so that Hiram was enabled\\r\\nto pile several tiers of stove-wood under the shed against the coming of\\r\\nMrs. Atterson to her farm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If the season wasn\\'t so far advanced, I could cut a lot of wood, draw\\r\\nit up, and hire a gasoline engine and saw to come on the place and saw\\r\\nus enough to last a year. I\\'ll do that next winter,\" Hiram said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what we all ought to do,\" agreed his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Pollock was an observing farmer\\'s boy and through him Hiram gained\\r\\nmany pointers as to the way the farmers in that locality put in their\\r\\ncrops and cultivated them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe learned, too, through Henry who was supposed to be the best farmer\\r\\nin the neighborhood, who had special success with certain crops, and who\\r\\nhad raised the best seedcorn in the locality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not particularly a trucking community; although, since Scoville\\r\\nhad begun to grow so fast and many city people had moved into that\\r\\npleasant town, the local demand for garden produce had increased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It used to be a saying here,\" said Henry, \"that a bushel of winter\\r\\nturnips would supply all the needs of Scoville. But that ain\\'t exactly\\r\\nso now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The stores all want green stuff in season, and are beginning to pay\\r\\ncash for truck instead of only offering to exchange groceries for the\\r\\nstuff we raise. I guess if a man understood truck raising he could make\\r\\nsomething in this market.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram decided that this was so, on looking over the marketing\\r\\npossibilities of Scoville.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a canning factory which put up string beans, corn, and\\r\\ntomatoes; but the prices per hundred-weight for these commodities did\\r\\nnot encourage Hiram to advise Mrs. Atterson to try and raise anything\\r\\nfor the canneries. A profit could not be made out of such crops on a\\r\\none-horse farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, the neighboring farmers did not plant their tomato seeds\\r\\nuntil it was pretty safe to do so in the open ground. The cannery did\\r\\nnot want the tomato pack to come on until late in August. By that time\\r\\nthe cream of the prices for garden-grown tomatoes had been skimmed by\\r\\nthe early truckers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same with sweet corn and green beans. The cannery demanded these\\r\\nvegetables at so late a date that the market-price was generally low.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese facts Hiram bore in mind as he planned his season\\'s work, and\\r\\nespecially the kitchen garden. This latter he planned to be about two\\r\\nacres in extent--rather a large plot, but he proposed to set his rows\\r\\nof almost every vegetable far enough apart to be worked with a horse\\r\\ncultivator.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome crops--for instance onions, carrots, and other \"fine stuff\"--must\\r\\nbe weeded by hand to an extent, and if the soil is rich enough rows\\r\\ntwelve or fifteen inches apart show better results.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween such rows a wheelhoe can be used to good advantage, and that\\r\\nwas one tool--with a seed-sowing combination--that Hiram had told Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson she must buy if he was to practically attend to the whole farm\\r\\nfor her. Hand-hoeing, in both field and garden crops, is antediluvian.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, during this week and a half of preparation, Hiram made ready for\\r\\nthe uprooting of Mrs. Atterson from the boarding house in Crawberry to\\r\\nthe farm some distance out of Scoville.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good lady had but one wagon load of goods to be transferred from\\r\\nher old quarters to the new home. Many of the articles she brought were\\r\\nheirlooms which she had stored in the boarding house cellar, or articles\\r\\nassociated with her happy married life, which had been shortened by her\\r\\nhusband\\'s death when he was comparatively a young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Mrs. Atterson saw piled on the wagon early on Saturday morning,\\r\\nand she had insisted upon climbing upon the seat beside the driver\\r\\nherself and riding with him all the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boarders gathered on the steps to see her go. The two spinster\\r\\nladies had already taken possession, and had served breakfast to the\\r\\ndisgruntled members of Mother Atterson\\'s family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll be back again,\" prophesied Mr. Crackit, shaking the old lady by\\r\\nthe hand. \"And when you do, just let me know. I\\'ll come and board with\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t have you in my house again, Fred Crackit, for two farms,\"\\r\\ndeclared the ex-boarding house keeper, with asperity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you told these people about my hot water, Mrs. Atterson,\"\\r\\ncroaked Mr. Peebles, from the step, where he stood muffled in a shawl\\r\\nbecause of the raw morning air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I didn\\'t you can tell \\'em yourself,\" returned she, with\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it went--the good-byes of these unappreciative boarders selfish\\r\\nto the last! Mother Atterson sighed--a long, happy, and satisfying\\r\\nsigh--when the lumbering wagon turned the first corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks be!\" she murmured. \"I sha\\'n\\'t care if they don\\'t have a driblet\\r\\nof gravy at supper tonight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she shook herself and stared straight ahead. On the very next\\r\\ncorner--she had insisted that none of the other people at the house\\r\\nshould observe their flitting--stood two figures, both forlorn.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Lem Camp, with a lean suit-case at his feet, and Sister with a\\r\\nbulging carpetbag which she had brought with her months before from the\\r\\ncharity institution, and into which she had stuffed everything she owned\\r\\nin the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir faces brightened perceptibly when they beheld Mrs. Atterson\\r\\nperched high beside the driver on the load of furniture and bedding. The\\r\\ndriver drew in his span of big horses and the wheels grated against the\\r\\ncurb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You climb right in behind, Mr. Camp,\" said the good lady. \"There\\'s room\\r\\nfor you up under the canvas top--and I had him spread a mattress so\\'t\\r\\nyou can take it easy all the way, if you like.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sister, you scramble up here and sit in betwixt me and this man. And do\\r\\nlook out--you\\'re spillin\\' things out o\\' that bag like it was a Christmas\\r\\ncornucopia. Come on, now! Toss it behind us, onto them other things.\\r\\nThere! we\\'ll go on--and no more stops, I hope, till we reach the farm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that couldn\\'t be. It was a long drive, and the man was good to his\\r\\nteam. He rested them at the top of every hill, and sometimes at the\\r\\nbottom. They had to stop two hours for dinner and to \"breathe \\'em,\" as\\r\\nthe man said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time Mother Atterson produced a goodsized market basket--her\\r\\nfamiliar companion when she had hunted bargains in the city--and it was\\r\\nfilled with sandwiches, and pickles, and crackers, and cookies, and\\r\\na whole boiled fowl (fowl were cheaper and more satisfying than the\\r\\nscrawny chickens then in market) and hard-boiled eggs, and cheese, with\\r\\nnumbers of other less important eatables tucked into corners of the\\r\\nbasket to \"wedge\" the larger packages of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four picnicked in the sun, with the furniture wagon to break the\\r\\nkeen wind, passing around hot coffee in a can, from hand to hand, the\\r\\ndriver having built a campfire to heat the coffee beside the country\\r\\nroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after that stop--for they were well into the country now--there was\\r\\nno keeping Sister on the wagon-seat. She had learned to drop down and\\r\\nmount again as lively as a cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tore along the edge of the road, with her hair flying, and her hat\\r\\nhanging by its ribbons. She chased a rabbit, and squirrels, and picked\\r\\ncertain green branches, and managed to get her hands and the front of\\r\\nher dress all \"stuck up\" with spruce gum in trying to get a piece big\\r\\nenough to chew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Drat the young\\'un!\" exclaimed Mother Atterson. \"I can see plainly\\r\\nI\\'d never ought to brought her, but should have sent her back to the\\r\\ninstitution. She\\'ll be as wild as Mr. March\\'s hare--whoever he was--out\\r\\nhere in the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Old Lem Camp gave her no trouble. He effaced himself just as he had\\r\\nat the boarding house supper table. He seldom spoke--never unless he was\\r\\nspoken to; and he lay up under the roof of the furniture wagon, whether\\r\\nasleep, or no, Mrs. Atterson could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s as odd as Dick\\'s hat-band,\" the ex-boarding house mistress\\r\\nconfided to the driver. \"But, bless you! the easiest critter to get\\r\\nalong with--you never saw his beat. If I\\'d a house full of Lem Camps to\\r\\ncook for, I\\'d think I was next door to heaven.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dusk when they arrived in sight of the little house beside the\\r\\nroad in which Uncle Jeptha Atterson had lived out his long life. Hiram\\r\\nhad a good fire going in both the kitchen and sitting room, and the\\r\\nlamplight flung through the windows made the place look cheerful indeed\\r\\nto the travelers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My soul and body!\" croaked the good lady, when she got down from the\\r\\nwagon and Hiram caught her in his arms to save her from a fall. \"I\\'m as\\r\\nstiff as a poker--and that\\'s a fact. But I\\'m glad to get here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram\\'s amazement when he saw Sister and Old Lem Camp was only expressed\\r\\nin his look. He said nothing. The driver of the wagon backed it to the\\r\\nporch step and then took out his team and, with Hiram\\'s help, led them\\r\\nto the stable, fed them, and bedded them down for the night. He was to\\r\\nsleep in one of the spare beds and go back to town the following day.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Atterson took off her best dress, slipped into a familiar old\\r\\ngingham and bustled around the kitchen as naturally as though she had\\r\\nbeen there all her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fried ham and eggs, and made biscuit, and opened a couple of tins of\\r\\npeaches she had brought, and finally set before them a repast satisfying\\r\\nif not dainty, and seasoned with a cheerful spirit at least.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I vum!\" she exclaimed, sitting down for the first time in years \"at the\\r\\nfirst table.\" \"If this don\\'t beat Crawberry and them boarders, I\\'m crazy\\r\\nas a loon. Pour the coffee, Sister--and don\\'t be stingy with the milk.\\r\\nMilk\\'s only five cents a quart here, and it\\'s eight in town. But,\\r\\ngracious, child! sugar don\\'t cost no less.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Lem Camp sat beside Hiram, as he had at the boarding-house table. He\\r\\nhad scarcely spoken since his arrival; but now, under cover of the talk\\r\\nof Mother Atterson, the driver of the furniture van, and Sister, he\\r\\nbegan one of his old-time monologues:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old, old--nothing to look forward to--then the prospect opens up--just\\r\\nlike light breaking through the clouds after a storm--let\\'s see; I want\\r\\na piece of bread--bread\\'s on Sister\\'s side--I can reach it--hum! no\\r\\nCrackit to-night--fool jokes--silly fellow--ah! the butter--Where\\'s the\\r\\nbutterknife?--Sister\\'s forgotten the butter-knife--no! here \\'tis--That\\r\\nwoman\\'s an angel--nothing less--an angel in a last season\\'s bonnet and a\\r\\nshabby gown--Hah! practical angels couldn\\'t use wings--they\\'d be in the\\r\\nway in the kitchen--ham and eggs--gravy--fit for gods to eat--and not to\\r\\nworry again where next week\\'s victuals are to come from!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram noted all the old mail said, and the last phrase enlightened him\\r\\nimmensely as to why Old Lem Camp was so \"queer.\" That was the trouble\\r\\non the old man\\'s mind--the trouble that had stifled him, and made him\\r\\nappear \"half cracked\" as the boarding-house jester and Peebles had said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLem Camp, too old to ever get another job in the city, had for five\\r\\nyears been worrying from day to day about his bare existence. And\\r\\nevidently he saw that bogie of the superannuated disappearing in the\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the truck driver had gone to bed, and Camp himself, and Sister had\\r\\nfallen asleep over the last of the dish-wiping, Mother Atterson confided\\r\\nin Hiram, to a degree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, this gal can be made useful. She can help me in the house, and she\\r\\ncan help outside, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She\\'s a poor, unfortunate creature--I know and humbly is no name for\\r\\nher looks! But mebbe we can send her to the school nearby, and she ought\\r\\nto get some color in her face if she\\'s out o\\' doors some--and some flesh\\r\\non her skinny body.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know as I could get along without Sister,\" ruminated Mother\\r\\nAtterson, shaking her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And as for Lem Camp--bless you! he won\\'t eat more\\'n a fly, and who else\\r\\nwould give him houseroom? Why, Hiram, I just had to bring him with me.\\r\\nIf I hadn\\'t, I\\'d felt just as conscience-stricken as though I\\'d moved\\r\\nand left a cat behind in an empty house!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV. GETTING IN THE EARLY CROPS\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Atterson had breakfast the next morning by lamplight, because the\\r\\ntruckman wanted to make an early start.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had already begun early rising, however, for the farmer who does\\r\\nnot get up before the sun in the spring needs must do his chores at\\r\\nnight by lantern-light. The eight-hour law can never be a rule on the\\r\\nfarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Sister was up, too, and out of the house, running as wild as a\\r\\nrabbit. Hiram caught her in the barnyard trying to clamber on the cow\\'s\\r\\nback to ride her about the enclosure. Sister was afraid of nothing that\\r\\nlived and walked, having all the courage of ignorance.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found that she could not in safety clamber over the pig-lot fence\\r\\nand catch one of the shoats. Old Mother Hog ran at her with open mouth\\r\\nand Sister came back from that expedition with a torn frock and some new\\r\\nexperience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never knew anything so fat could run,\" she confided to Hiram. \"Old\\r\\nMissus Poundly, who lived on our block, and weighed three hundred\\r\\npounds, couldn\\'t run, I bet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Camp was not disturbed by Mrs. Atterson, but was allowed to sleep as\\r\\nlong as he liked, while she kept a little breakfast hot for him and the\\r\\ncoffeepot on the back of the stove.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old lady became interested at once in all Hiram had done toward\\r\\nbeginning the spring work. She learned about the seed in the window\\r\\nboxes (some of them were already breaking the soil) about watering them\\r\\nand covering them properly and immediately took those duties off Hiram\\'s\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If Sister an\\' me can\\'t do the light chores around this place and leave\\r\\nyou to \\'tend to the bigger things, then we ain\\'t no good and had better\\r\\ngo back to the boarding house,\" she announced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Mis\\' Atterson! You wouldn\\'t go back to town, would you?\" pleaded\\r\\nSister. \"Why, there\\'s real hens--and a cow that will give milk bimeby,\\r\\nHi says--and a horse that wiggles his ears and talks right out loud when\\r\\nhe\\'s hungry, for I heard him--and pigs that squeal and run, an\\' they\\'re\\r\\njest as fat as butter----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, to stay here we\\'ve all got to work, Sister,\" declared her\\r\\nmistress. \"So get at them dishes now and be quick about it.\\r\\nThere\\'s forty times more chores to do here than there was back in\\r\\nCrawberry--But, thanks be! there ain\\'t no gravy to worry about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And there ain\\'t no boarders to make fun of me,\" said Sister,\\r\\nthoughtfully. Then, she announced, after some rumination: \"I like pigs\\r\\nbetter than I do boarders Mis\\' Atterson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I should think you would!\" exclaimed that lady, tartly. \"Pigs has\\r\\ngot some sense.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram laughed at this. \"You\\'ll find the pigs demanding gravy, just the\\r\\nsame--and very urgent about it they are, too,\" he told them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was glad to give the small chores over into their hands, and went\\r\\nto work immediately to prepare for putting in the early crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had already cleared the rubbish off the piece of ground selected\\r\\nfor the garden, and had burned it. He hauled out stable manure from\\r\\nthe barnyard and gave an acre and a half of this piece of land a good\\r\\ndressing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other half-acre was for early potatoes, and he wished to put the\\r\\nmanure in the furrow for them, so did not top dress that strip of land.\\r\\nThe frost was pretty well out of the ground by now; but even if some\\r\\nremained, plowing this high, well-drained piece would do no harm.\\r\\nBeside, Hiram was eager to get in early crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a still, hazy morning when he geared the old horse to the plow\\r\\nand headed him into the garden piece. He had determined to plow the\\r\\nentire plot at once, and instead of plowing \"around and around\" had\\r\\npaced off his lands and started in the middle, plowing \"gee\" instead of\\r\\n\"haw\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThis system is a bit more particular, and hard for the careless plowman;\\r\\nbut it overcomes that unsightly \"dead-furrow\" in the middle of a field\\r\\nand brings the \"finishing-furrow\" on the edge. This insures better\\r\\nsurface drainage and is a more scientific method of tillage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plow was rusty and the point was not in the very best condition; but\\r\\nafter the first few rounds the share was cleaned off, and it began to\\r\\nslip through the moist earth and roll it over in a long, brown ribbon\\r\\nbehind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram Strong clung to the plow handles, a rope-rein in each hand, and\\r\\nwatched the plow and the horse and the land ahead with an eye as keen as\\r\\nthat of a river-pilot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the strip of turned earth grew wider and longer Sister ran out to see\\r\\nhim work. She watched the plow turn the mulch into the furrow and lay\\r\\nthe brown, greasy mold upon it, with wide-open eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why!\" cried she, \"wouldn\\'t it be nice if we could go right along with\\r\\na plow and bury our past like that--cover everything mean and nasty\\r\\nup, and forget it! That institution they put me in--and the old woman\\r\\nI lived with before that, who drank so much gin and beat me--and the\\r\\nboarders--and that boy who used to pull my braids whenever he met me--My\\r\\nthat would be fine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I reckon that is what Life does do for us,\" returned Hiram,\\r\\nthoughtfully, stopping at the end of the furrow to mop his brow and let\\r\\nthe old horse breathe. \"Yes, sir! Life plows all the experience under,\\r\\nand it ought to enrich our future existence, just as this stuff I\\'m\\r\\nplowing under here will decay and enrich the soil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the plow don\\'t turn it quite under in spots,\" said Sister, with\\r\\na sigh. \"Leastways, I can\\'t help remembering the bad things once in a\\r\\nwhile.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were certain other individuals who found out very soon that Hiram\\r\\nwas plowing, too. Those were the hens. There were not more than fifteen\\r\\nor twenty of the scrubby creatures, and they began to follow the plow\\r\\nand pick up grubs and worms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you one thing that I\\'ve got to do before we put in much,\" Hiram\\r\\ntold the ex-boarding house mistress at noon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that, Hi? Don\\'t go very deep down into my pocket, for it won\\'t\\r\\nstand it. After paying my bills, and paying for moving out here, I ain\\'t\\r\\ngot much money left--and that\\'s a fact!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It won\\'t cost much, but we\\'ve got to have a yard for the hens. Hens and\\r\\na garden will never mix successfully. Unless you enclose them you might\\r\\nas well have no garden in that spot where I\\'m plowing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There warn\\'t but five eggs to-day,\" said Mrs. Atterson. \"Mebbe we\\'d\\r\\nbetter chop the heads off \\'em, one after the other, and eat \\'em.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'ll lay better as it grows warmer. That henhouse must be fixed\\r\\nbefore next winter. It\\'s too draughty,\" said Hi. \"And then, hens can\\'t\\r\\nlay well--especially through the winter--if they haven\\'t the proper kind\\r\\nof food.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But three or four of the dratted things want to stay on the nest all\\r\\nthe time,\" complained the old lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I was you, Mrs. Atterson,\" Hiram said, soberly, \"I\\'d spend five\\r\\ndollars for a hundred eggs of well-bred stock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d set these hens as fast as they get broody, and raise a decent flock\\r\\nof biddies for next year. Scrub hens are just as bad as scrub cows. The\\r\\nscrubs will eat quite as much as full-bloods, yet the returns from the\\r\\nscrubs are much less.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I declare!\" exclaimed Mrs. Atterson, \"a hen\\'s always been just a hen\\r\\nto me--one\\'s the same as another, exceptin\\' the feathers on some is\\r\\nprettier.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-night I\\'ll show you some breeders\\' catalogs and you can think the\\r\\nmatter over as to what kind of a fowl you want,\" said the young farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went back to his job after dinner and kept steadily at work until\\r\\nthree o\\'clock before there came a break. Then he saw a carriage drive\\r\\ninto the yard, and a few moments later a man In a long gray coat came\\r\\nstriding across the lot toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram knew the gentleman at once--it was Mr. Bronson, the father of\\r\\nthe girl he had saved from the runaway. To tell the truth, the boy\\r\\nhad rather wondered about his non-appearance during the days that\\r\\nhad elapsed. But now he came with hand held out, and his first words\\r\\nexplained the seeming omission:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been away for more than a week, my boy, or I should have seen you\\r\\nbefore. You\\'re Hiram Strong, aren\\'t you--the boy my little girl has been\\r\\ntalking so much about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know how much Miss Lettie has been talking about me,\" laughed\\r\\nHiram. \"Full and plenty, I expect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And small blame to her,\" declared Mr. Bronson. \"I won\\'t waste time\\r\\ntelling you how grateful I am. I had just time to turn that boy of\\r\\nDickerson\\'s off before I was called away. Now, my lad, I want you to\\r\\ncome and work for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, much as I might like to, sir, I couldn\\'t do that,\" said Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, now! we\\'ll fix it somehow. Lettie has set her heart on having you\\r\\naround the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re the second young man I\\'ve been after whom I was sure would suit\\r\\nme, since we moved on to the old Fleigler place. The first fellow I\\r\\ncan\\'t find; but don\\'t tell me that I am going to be disappointed in you,\\r\\ntoo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bronson,\" said Hiram, gravely, \"I\\'m sorry to say \\'No.\\' A little\\r\\nwhile ago I\\'d have been delighted to take up with any fair offer you\\r\\nmight have made me. But I have agreed with Mrs. Atterson to run her\\r\\nplace for two seasons.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two years!\" exclaimed Mr. Bronson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir. Practically. I must put her on her feet and make the old farm\\r\\nshow a profit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re pretty young to take such responsibility upon your shoulders,\\r\\nare you not?\" queried the gentleman, eyeing him curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m seventeen. I began to work with my father as soon as I could lift\\r\\na hoe. I love farm work. And I\\'ve passed my word to stick to Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the old lady up to the house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she wouldn\\'t hold you to your bargain if she saw you could better\\r\\nyourself, would she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She would not have to,\" Hiram said, firmly, and he began to feel a\\r\\nlittle disappointed in his caller. \"A bargain\\'s a bargain--there\\'s no\\r\\nbacking out of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But suppose I should make it worth her while to give you up?\" pursued\\r\\nMr. Bronson. \"I\\'ll sound her a bit, eh? I tell you that Lettie has set\\r\\nher heart on having you, as we cannot find another chap whom we were\\r\\nlooking for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Hiram knew that this referred to him; but he said nothing. Besides,\\r\\nhe did not feel too greatly pleased that the strongest reason for Mr.\\r\\nBronson\\'s wishing to hire him was his little daughter\\'s demand. It was\\r\\njust a fancy of Miss Lettie\\'s. And another day, she might have the fancy\\r\\nto turn him off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir,\" spoke Hiram, more firmly. \"It is useless. I am obliged to\\r\\nyou; but I must stick by Mrs. Atterson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my lad,\" said the Westerner, putting out his hand again. \"I am\\r\\nglad to see you know how to keep a promise, even if it isn\\'t to your\\r\\nadvantage. And I am grateful to you for turning that trick for my little\\r\\ngirl the other day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you\\'ll come over and see us--and I shall watch your work here.\\r\\nMost of these fellows around here are pretty slovenly farmers in my\\r\\nestimation; I hope you will do better than the average.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went back across the field and Hiram returned to his plowing. The\\r\\nyoung farmer saw the bay horses driven slowly out of the yard and along\\r\\nthe road.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw the flutter of a scarf from the carriage and knew that Lettie\\r\\nBronson was with her father; but she did not look out at him as he\\r\\ntoiled behind the old horse in the furrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there was no feeling of disappointment in Hiram Strong\\'s\\r\\nmind--and this fact somewhat surprised him. He had been so attracted by\\r\\nthe girl, and had wished in the beginning so much to be engaged by Mr.\\r\\nBronson, that he had considered it a mighty disappointment when he had\\r\\nlost the Westerner\\'s card.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, his apathy in the matter was easily explained. He had taken\\r\\nhold of the work on the Atterson place. His plans were growing in his\\r\\nmind for the campaign before him. His interest was fastened upon the\\r\\ncontract he had made with the old lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hand was, literally now, \"to the plow\"--and he was not looking back.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe finished the piece that day, and likewise drew out some lime that he\\r\\nhad bought at Scoville and spread it broadcast upon all the garden patch\\r\\nsave that in which he intended to put potatoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough it is an exploded doctrine that the application of lime to\\r\\npotato ground causes scab, it is a fact that it will aid in spreading\\r\\nthe disease. Hiram was sure enough--because of the sheep-sorrel on the\\r\\npiece--that it all needed sweetening, but he decided against the lime at\\r\\nthis time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Hiram had drag-harrowed the piece he laid off two rows down\\r\\nthe far end, as being less tempting to the straying hens, and planted\\r\\nearly peas--the round-seeded variety, hardier than the wrinkled kinds.\\r\\nThese pea-rows were thirty inches apart, and he dropped the peas by hand\\r\\nand planted them very thickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t pay to be niggardly with seed in putting in early peas, at\\r\\nany rate--the thicker they come up the better, and in these low bush\\r\\nvarieties the thickly growing vines help support each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis garden piece--almost two acres--was oblong in shape. An acre is\\r\\njust about seventy paces square. Hiram\\'s garden was seventy by a hundred\\r\\nand forty paces, or thereabout.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the young farmer had two seventy-yard rows of peas, or over\\r\\nfour hundred feet of drill. He planted two quarts of peas at a cost of\\r\\nseventy cents.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith ordinary fortune the crop should be much more than sufficient for\\r\\nthe needs of the house while the peas were in a green state, for being a\\r\\nquick growing vegetable, they are soon past.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram, however, proposed putting in a surplus of almost everything he\\r\\nplanted in this big garden--especially of the early vegetables--for he\\r\\nbelieved that there would be a market for them in Scoville.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ground was very cold yet, and snow flurries swept over the field\\r\\nevery few days; but the peas were under cover and were off his mind;\\r\\nHiram knew they would be ready to pop up above the surface just as soon\\r\\nas the warm weather came in earnest, and peas do not easily rot in the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two weeks, or when the weather was settled, he proposed planting\\r\\nother kinds of peas alongside these first two rows, so as to have a\\r\\nsuccession up to mid-summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext the young farmer laid off his furrows for early potatoes. He had\\r\\nbought a sack of an extra-early variety, yet a potato that, if left\\r\\nin the ground the full length of the season, would make a good winter\\r\\nvariety--a \"long keeper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis potato rows he planned to have three feet apart, and he plowed the\\r\\nfurrows twice, so as to have them clean and deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Pollock happened to come by while he was doing this, and stopped\\r\\nto talk and watch Hiram. To tell the truth, Henry and his folks were\\r\\nmore than a little interested in what the young farmer would do with the\\r\\nAtterson place.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other neighbors they doubted if the stranger knew as much about the\\r\\npractical work of farming as he claimed to know. \"That feller from\\r\\nthe city,\" the neighbors called Hiram behind his back, and that is an\\r\\nexpression that completely condemns a man in the mind of the average\\r\\ncountryman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What yer bein\\' so particular with them furrers for, Hiram?\" asked\\r\\nHenry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If a job\\'s worth doing at all, it\\'s worth doing well, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\nlaughed the young farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We spread our manure broadcast--when we use any at all--for potatoes,\"\\r\\nsaid Henry, slowly. \"Dad says if manure comes in contact with potatoes,\\r\\nthey are apt to rot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That seems to be a general opinion,\" replied Hiram. \"And it may be so\\r\\nunder certain conditions. For that reason I am going to make sure that\\r\\nnot much of this fertilizer comes in direct contact with my seed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How\\'ll you do that?\" \"I\\'ll show you,\" said Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving run out his rows and covered the bottom of each furrow several\\r\\ninches deep with the manure, he ran his plow down one side of each\\r\\nfurrow and turned the soil back upon the fertilizer, covering it and\\r\\nleaving a well pulverized seed bed for the potatoes to lie in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Henry, \"that\\'s a good wrinkle, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had purchased some formalin, mixed it with water according to the\\r\\nGovernment expert\\'s instructions, and from time to time soaked his seed\\r\\npotatoes two hours in the antiseptic bath. In the evening he brought\\r\\nthem into the kitchen and they all--even Old Lem Camp--cut up the\\r\\npotatoes, leaving two or three good eyes in each piece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d ruther do this than peel \\'em for the boarders,\" remarked Sister,\\r\\nlooking at her deeply-stained fingers reflectively. \"And then, nobody\\r\\nwon\\'t say nothin\\' about my hands to me when I\\'m passin\\' dishes at the\\r\\ntable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day she helped Hiram drop the seed, and by night he had\\r\\ncovered them by running his plow down the other side of the row and\\r\\nthen smoothed the potato plat with a home-made \"board\" in lieu of a\\r\\nland-roller.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the twentieth of March, and not a farmer in the locality had yet\\r\\nput in either potatoes, or peas. Some had not as yet plowed for early\\r\\npotatoes, and Henry Pollock warned Hiram that he was \"rushing the\\r\\nseason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That may be,\" declared the young farmer to Mrs. Atterson. \"But I\\r\\nbelieve the risk is worth taking. If we do get \\'em good, we\\'ll get \\'em\\r\\nearly and skim the cream of the local market. Now, you see!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV. TROUBLE BREWS\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old Lem Camp,\" as he had been called for so many years that there\\r\\nseemed no disrespect in the title, was waking up. Not many mornings was\\r\\nhe a lie-abed. And the lines in his forehead seemed to be smoothing out,\\r\\nand his eyes had lost something of their dullness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true that, at first, he wandered about the farmstead muttering\\r\\nto himself in his old way--an endless monologue which was a jumble of\\r\\ncomment, gratitude, and the brief memories of other days. It took some\\r\\ntime to adjust his poor mind to the fact that he had no longer to\\r\\nfear that Poverty which had stalked ever before him like a threatening\\r\\nspirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nGratitude spurred him to the use of his hands. He was not a broken\\r\\nman--not bodily. Many light tasks soon fell to his share, and Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson told Hiram and Sister to let him do what he would. To busy\\r\\nhimself would be the best thing in the world for the old fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what\\'s been the matter with Mr. Camp for years,\" she declared,\\r\\nwith conviction. \"Because he passed the sixty-year mark, and it was\\r\\nagainst the practise of the paper company to keep employees on the\\r\\npayroll over that age, they turned Lem Camp off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ridiculous! He was just as well able to do the tasks that he had\\r\\nlearned to do mechanically as he had been any time for the previous\\r\\ntwenty years. He had worked in that office forty years, and more, you\\r\\nunderstand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the worst thing about a corporation of that kind--it has no\\r\\nthought beyond its \\'rules.\\' Old Mr. Bundy remembered Lem--that\\'s all.\\r\\nIf he hadn\\'t so much stock in the concern they\\'d turn him off, too. I\\r\\nexpect he knows it and that\\'s what softened his heart to Old Lem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, let Lem take hold of whatever he can do, and git interested in\\r\\nit,\" declared the practical Mrs. Atterson, \"and he\\'ll show you that\\r\\nthere\\'s work left in him yet. Yes-sir-ree-sir! And if he\\'ll work in the\\r\\nopen air, all the better for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was plenty for everybody to do, and Hiram would not say the old\\r\\nman nay. The seed boxes needed a good deal of attention, for they were\\r\\nto be lifted out into the air on warm days, and placed in the sun. And\\r\\nOld Lem could do this--and stir the soil in them, and pull out the grass\\r\\nand other weeds that started.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had planted early cabbage and cauliflower and egg-plant in other\\r\\nboxes, and the beets were almost big enough to transplant to the open\\r\\nground. Beets are hardy and although hair-roots are apt to form on\\r\\ntransplanted garden beets, the transplanting aids the growth in other\\r\\nways and Hiram expected to have table-beets very early.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the garden itself he had already run out two rows of later beets, the\\r\\nwidth of the plot. Bunched beets will sell for a fair price the whole\\r\\nseason through.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram was giving his whole heart and soul to the work--he was wrapped up\\r\\nin the effort to make the farm pay. And for good reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was \"up to him\" to not alone turn a profit for his employer, and\\r\\nhimself; but he desired--oh, how strongly!--to show the city folk who\\r\\nhad sneered at him that he could be a success in the right environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, and in addition, Hiram Strong was ambitious--very ambitious\\r\\nindeed for a youth of his age. He wanted to own a farm of his own in\\r\\ntime--and it was no \"one-horse farm\" he aimed at.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, indeed! Hiram had read of the scientific farming of the Middle West,\\r\\nand the enormous tracts in the Northwest devoted to grain and other\\r\\nstaple crops, where the work was done for the most part by machinery.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe longed to see all this--and to take part in it. He desired the big\\r\\nthings in farming, nor would he ever be content to remain a helper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to be my own boss, some day--and I\\'m going to boss other men.\\r\\nI\\'ll show these fellows around here that I know what I want, and when I\\r\\nget it I\\'ll handle it right!\" Hiram soliloquized.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s up to me to save every cent I can. Henry thinks I\\'m niggardly,\\r\\nI expect, because I wouldn\\'t go to town Saturday night with him. But I\\r\\nhaven\\'t any money to waste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The hundred I\\'m to get next Christmas from Mrs. Atterson I don\\'t wish\\r\\nto draw on at all. I\\'ll get along with such old clothes as I\\'ve got.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram was not naturally a miser; he frequently bought some little thing\\r\\nfor Sister when he went to town--a hair-ribbon, or the like, which he\\r\\nknew would please the girl; but for himself he was determined to be\\r\\nsaving.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of his contract with Mrs. Atterson he would have two hundred\\r\\ndollars anyway. But that was not the end and aim of Hiram Strong\\'s\\r\\nhopes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the clause in our agreement about the profits of our second season\\r\\nthat is my bright and shining star,\" he told the good lady more than\\r\\nonce. \"I don\\'t know yet what we had better put in next year to bring us\\r\\na fortune; but we\\'ll know before it comes time to plant it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the wheel-hoe and seeder he had insisted upon Mrs. Atterson\\r\\nbuying had arrived, and Hiram, after studying the instructions which\\r\\ncame with it, set the machine up as a seed-sower. Later, after the\\r\\nbulk of the seeds were in the ground, he would take off the seeding\\r\\nattachment and bolt on the hoe, or cultivator attachments, with which to\\r\\nstir the soil between the narrower rows of vegetables.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he made ready to plant seeds such as carrot, parsnip, onion, salsify,\\r\\nand leaf-beet, as well as spring spinach, early turnips, radishes and\\r\\nkohlrabi, Hiram worked that part of his plowed land over again and again\\r\\nwith the spike harrow, finally boarding the strips down smoothly as\\r\\nhe wished to plant them. The seedbed must be as level as a floor, and\\r\\ncompact, for good use to be made of the wheel-seeder.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had lined out one row with his garden line, from side to side of\\r\\nthe plowed strip, the marking arrangement attached to his seeder would\\r\\nmark the following lines plainly, and at just the distance he desired.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnions, carrots, and the like, he put in fifteen inches apart, intending\\r\\nto do all the cultivating of those extremely small plants with the\\r\\nwheel-hoe, after they were large enough. But he foresaw the many hours\\r\\nof cultivating before him and marked the rows for the bulk of the\\r\\nvegetables far enough apart, as he had first intended, to make possible\\r\\nthe use of the horse-hoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile he spike-harrowed the potato patch, running cross-wise of the\\r\\nrows to break the crust and keep down the quick-springing weed seeds.\\r\\nThe early peas were already above ground and when they were two inches\\r\\nhigh Hiram ran his 14-tooth cultivator--or \"seed harrow\" as it is called\\r\\nin some localities--close to the rows so as to throw the soil toward the\\r\\nplants, almost burying them from sight again. This was to give the peas\\r\\ndeep rootage, which is a point necessary for the quick and stable growth\\r\\nof this vegetable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn odd moments Hiram had cut and set a few posts, bought poultry netting\\r\\nin Scoville, and enclosed Mrs. Atterson\\'s chicken-run. She had taken his\\r\\nadvice and sent for eggs, and already had four hens setting and expected\\r\\nto set the remainder of the of the eggs in a few days.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister took an enormous interest in this poultry-raising venture. She\\r\\n\"counted chickens before they were hatched\" with a vengeance, and after\\r\\nreading a few of the poultry catalogs she figured out that, in three\\r\\nyears, from the increase of Mother Atterson\\'s hundred eggs, the\\r\\neighty-acre farm would not be large enough to contain the flock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And all from five dollars!\" gasped Sister. \"I don\\'t see why everybody\\r\\ndoesn\\'t go to raising chickens--then there\\'d be no poor folks, everybody\\r\\nwould be rich--Well! I expect there\\'d always have to be institutions for\\r\\norphans--and boarding houses!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new-springing things from the ground, the \"hen industry\" and the\\r\\nrepairing and beautifying of the outside of the farmhouse did not take\\r\\nup all their attention. There were serious matters to be discussed in\\r\\nthe evening, after the others had gone to bed, \\'twixt Hiram and his\\r\\nemployer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was the five or six acres of bottom land--the richest piece of\\r\\nsoil of the entire eighty. Hiram had not forgotten this, and the second\\r\\nSunday of their stay at the farm, after the whole family had attended\\r\\nservice at a chapel less than half a mile up the road, he had urged Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson to walk with him through the timber to the riverside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the Land o\\' Goshen!\" the ex-boarding house mistress had finally\\r\\nexclaimed. \"To think that I own all of this. Why, Hi, it don\\'t seem as\\r\\nif it was so. I can\\'t get used to it. And this timber, you say, is all\\r\\nworth money? And if I cut it off, it will grow up again----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In thirty to forty years the pine will be worth cutting again--and some\\r\\nof the other trees,\" said Hiram, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! that would be something for Sister to look forward to,\" said\\r\\nthe old lady, evidently thinking aloud. \"And I don\\'t expect her\\r\\nfolks--whoever they be--will ever look her up now, Hiram.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But with the timber cut and this side hill cleared, you would have a\\r\\nvery valuable thirty acres, or so, of tillage--valuable for almost any\\r\\ncrop, and early, too, for it slopes toward the sun,\" said the young\\r\\nfarmer, ignoring the other\\'s observation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well! it\\'s wonderful,\" returned Mrs. Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she listened attentively to what he had to say about clearing the\\r\\nbottom land, which was a much more easily accomplished task, as Hiram\\r\\nshowed her. It would cost something to put the land into shape for\\r\\nlate corn, and so prepare it for some more valuable crop the following\\r\\nseason.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, nothing ventured, nothing have!\" Mrs. Atterson finally agreed.\\r\\n\"Go ahead--if it won\\'t cost much more than what you say to get the corn\\r\\nin. I understand it\\'s a gamble, and I\\'m taking a gambler\\'s chance.\\r\\nIf the river rises and floods the corn in June, or July, then we get\\r\\nnothing this season?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a possibility,\" admitted Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go ahead,\" exclaimed Mother Atterson. \"I never did know that there was\\r\\nsporting blood in me; but I kinder feel it risin\\', Hi, with the sap in\\r\\nthe trees. We\\'ll chance it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally Hiram had stepped down to the pasture and squinted across\\r\\nto the water-hole. The grass was not long enough yet to turn the cow\\r\\ninto the field, so he was obliged to make these special trips to the\\r\\npasture.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had seen nothing of the Dickersons--to speak to, that is--since his\\r\\ntrouble with Pete. And, of a sudden, just before dinner one noon, Hiram\\r\\ntook a look at the pasture and beheld a figure seemingly working down in\\r\\nthe corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram ran swiftly in that direction. Half-way there he saw that it was\\r\\nPete, and that he had deliberately cut out a panel of the fence and was\\r\\nletting a pair of horses he had been plowing with, drink at the pool,\\r\\nbefore he took them home to the Dickerson stable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram stopped running and recovered his breath before he reached the\\r\\nlower corner of the pasture. Pete saw him coming, and grinned impudently\\r\\nat him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing here, Dickerson?\" demanded the young farmer,\\r\\nindignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, if you wanter keep us out, you\\'d better keep up your fences\\r\\nbetter,\" returned Pete. \"I seen the wires down, and it\\'s handy----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cut those wires!\" interrupted Hiram, angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re another,\" drawled Pete, but grinning in a way to exasperate the\\r\\nyoung farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you did so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wal, if you know so much, what are you going to do about it?\" demanded\\r\\nthe other. \"I guess you\\'ll find that these wires will snap \\'bout as fast\\r\\nas you can mend \\'em. Now, you can put that in your pipe an\\' smoke it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t smoke.\" Hiram observed, growing calm immediately. There was\\r\\nno use in giving this lout the advantage of showing anger with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Smartie!\" snarled Pete Dickerson. \"Now, you see, there\\'s somebody\\r\\njust as smart as you be. These horses have drunk there, and they\\'re\\r\\ngoing to drink again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that your father yonder?\" demanded Hiram, shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Call him over here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, if he comes over here, he\\'ll eat you alive!\" cried Pete,\\r\\nlaughing. \"You don\\'t know my dad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t; but I want to,\" Hiram said, calmly. \"That\\'s why you\\'d better\\r\\ncall him over. I have got pretty well acquainted with you, and the rest\\r\\nof your family can\\'t be any worse, as I look at it. Call him over,\" and\\r\\nthe young farmer stepped nearer to the lout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You call him yourself!\" cried Pete, beginning to back away, for he\\r\\nremembered how he had been treated at his previous encounter with Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram seized the bridles of the work horses, and shook them out of\\r\\nPete\\'s clutch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell your father to come here,\" commanded the young farmer, fire in his\\r\\neyes. \"We\\'ll settle this thing here and now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These horses are on Mrs. Atterson\\'s land. I know the county stock\\r\\nlaw as well as you do. You cut this fence, and your cattle are on her\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will cost you a dollar a head to get them off again--if Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson wishes to demand it. Now, call your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPete raised a yell which startled the long-legged man striding over the\\r\\nhill toward the Dickerson farmhouse. Hiram saw the older Dickerson turn,\\r\\nstare, and then start toward them.\\r\\n\\r\\nPete continued to beckon, and began to yell:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dad! Dad! He won\\'t let me have the hosses!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSam Dickerson came striding down to the waterhole--a lean, long,\\r\\nsour-looking man he was, with a brown face knotted into a continual\\r\\nscowl, and hard, bony hands. Yet Hiram was not afraid of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the trouble here?\" growled the farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s got the hosses. I told you the fence was down and I was goin\\' to\\r\\nwater \\'em----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shut up!\" commanded his father, eyeing Hiram. \"I\\'m talking to this\\r\\nfellow: What\\'s the trouble here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your horses are on Mrs. Atterson\\'s land,\" Hiram said, quietly. \"You\\r\\nknow that stock which strays can be held for a dollar a head--damage or\\r\\nno damage to crops. I warn you, keep your horses on your own land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s your fence; if you don\\'t keep it up, who\\'s fault is it if my\\r\\nhorses get on your land?\" growled Dickerson, evidently making the matter\\r\\na personal one with Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your boy here cut the wires.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No I didn\\'t, Dad!\" interposed Pete.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuick as a flash Hiram dropped the bridle reins, sprang for Pete, seized\\r\\nhim in a wrestler\\'s grip, twisted him around, and tore from his pocket a\\r\\npair of heavy wire-cutters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What were you doing with these in your pocket, then?\" demanded Hiram,\\r\\ndisdainfully, tossing the plyers upon the ground at Pete\\'s feet, and\\r\\nstepping back to keep the restless horses from leaving the edge of the\\r\\nwater-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam Dickerson seemed to take a grim pleasure in his son\\'s overthrow. He\\r\\ngrowled:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s got you there, Pete. You\\'d better stop monkeyin\\' around here. Pick\\r\\nup them bridles and come on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to depart without another word to Hiram; but the latter did\\r\\nnot propose to be put off that way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold on!\" he called. \"Who\\'s going to mend this fence, Mr. Dickerson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDickerson turned and eyed him coldly again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that to me? Mend your own fence,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I shall take these horses up to our barn. You can come and settle\\r\\nthe matter with Mrs. Atterson--unless you wish to pay me two dollars\\r\\nhere and now,\" said the young farmer, his voice carrying clearly to\\r\\nwhere the man stood upon the rising ground above him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you young whelp!\" roared Dickerson, suddenly starting down the\\r\\nslope.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram Strong neither moved nor showed fear. Somehow, this sturdy\\r\\nyoung fellow, in the high laced boots, with his flannel shirt open at\\r\\nthe throat, raw as was the day, his sleeves rolled back to his elbows,\\r\\nwas a figure to make even a more muscular man than Sam Dickerson\\r\\nhesitate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pete!\" exclaimed the farmer, harshly, still eyeing Hiram. \"Run up to\\r\\nthe house and bring my shotgun. Be quick about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram said never a word, and the horses, yoked together, began to crop\\r\\nthe short grass springing upon the bank of the water-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll find out you\\'re fooling with the wrong man, you whippersnapper!\"\\r\\npromised Dickerson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can pay me two dollars and I\\'ll mend the fence; or you can mend the\\r\\nfence and we\\'ll call it square,\" said Hiram, slowly, and evenly. \"I\\'m a\\r\\nboy, but I\\'m not to be frightened with a threat----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPete\\'s long legs brought him flying back across the fields. Nothing he\\r\\nhad done in a long while pleased him quite as much as this errand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram turned, jerked at the horses\\' bridle-reins, turned them around,\\r\\nand with a sharp slap on the nigh one\\'s flank, sent them both trotting\\r\\nup into the Atterson pasture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop that, you rascal!\" cried Dickerson, grabbing the gun from his\\r\\nhopeful son, and losing his head now entirely. \"Bring that team back!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mend the fence, and I will,\" declared Hiram, unshaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe angry man sprang down to his level, flourishing the gun in a way\\r\\nthat would have been dangerous indeed had Hiram believed it to be\\r\\nloaded. And as it was, the young farmer was very angry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right was on his side; if he allowed these Dickersons, father and\\r\\nson, to browbeat him this once, it would only lead to future trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thing had to be settled right here and now. It would never do for\\r\\nHiram to show fear. And if both of the long-legged Dickersons pitched\\r\\nupon him, of course, he would be no match for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Sam Dickerson stumbled and almost fell as he reached the edge of the\\r\\nwater-hole, and before he could recover himself, Hiram leaped upon him,\\r\\nseized the shotgun, and wrenched it from his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reversed the weapon in a flash, clubbed it, and raised it over his\\r\\nhead with a threatening swing that made Pete yell from the top of the\\r\\nbank:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look out, Dad! He\\'s a-goin\\' ter swat yer!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSam tried to scramble out of the way. But down came the gun butt with\\r\\nall the force of Hiram\\'s good muscle, and--the stock was splintered and\\r\\nthe lock shattered upon the big stone that here cropped out of the bank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s your gun--what\\'s left of it,\" panted the young farmer, tossing\\r\\nthe broken weapon from him. \"Now, don\\'t you ever threaten me with a gun\\r\\nagain, for if you do I\\'ll have you arrested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve got to be neighbors, and we\\'ve got to get along in a neighborly\\r\\nmanner. But I\\'m not going to allow you to take advantage of Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson, because she is a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Mr. Dickerson,\" he added, as the man scrambled up, glaring at him\\r\\nevidently with more surprise than anger, \"if you\\'ll make Pete mend this\\r\\nfence, you can have your horses. Otherwise I\\'m going to \\'pound\\' them\\r\\naccording to the stock law of the county.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pete,\" said his father, briefly, \"go get your hammer and staples and\\r\\nmend this fence up as good as you found it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now,\" said Hiram, \"I\\'m going home to gear the horse to the wagon,\\r\\nand I\\'ll drive over to your house, Mr. Dickerson. From time to time you\\r\\nhave borrowed while Uncle Jeptha was alive quite a number of tools. I\\r\\nwant them. I have made inquiries and I know what tools they are. Just be\\r\\nprepared to put them into my wagon, will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned on his heel without further words and left the Dickersons\\r\\nto catch their horses, and to repair the fence--both of which they did\\r\\npromptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only that, but when Hiram drove into the Dickerson dooryard an hour\\r\\nlater he had no trouble about recovering the tools which the neighbor\\r\\nhad borrowed and failed to return.\\r\\n\\r\\nPete scowled at him and muttered uncomplimentary remarks; but Sam\\r\\nphlegmatically smoked his pipe and sat watching the young farmer without\\r\\nany comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so, that much is accomplished,\" ruminated Hiram, as he drove home.\\r\\n\"But I\\'m not sure whether hostilities are finished, or have just begun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV. ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old Atterson place\" as it was called in the neighborhood, began to\\r\\ntake on a brisk appearance these days. Sister, with the help of Old Lem\\r\\nCamp, had long since raked the dooryard clean and burned the rubbish\\r\\nwhich is bound to gather during the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nYears before there had been flower beds in front; but Uncle Jeptha had\\r\\nallowed the grass to overrun them. It was a month too early to think of\\r\\nplanting many flowers; but Hiram had bought some seeds, and he showed\\r\\nSister how to prepare boxes for them in the sunny kitchen windows, along\\r\\nwith the other plant boxes; and around the front porch he spaded up a\\r\\nstrip, enriched it well, and almost the first seeds put into the ground\\r\\non the farm were the sweet peas around this porch. Mother Atterson was\\r\\nvery fond of these flowers and had always managed to coax some of them\\r\\nto grow even in the boarding-house back yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the side porch she proposed to have morning-glories and moon-flowers,\\r\\nwhile the beds in front would be filled with those old-fashioned flowers\\r\\nwhich everybody loves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if we can\\'t make our own flower-beds, we can go without them, Hi,\"\\r\\nsaid the bustling old lady. \"We mustn\\'t take you from your other work\\r\\nto spade beds for us. Every cat\\'s got to catch mice on this place, now I\\r\\ntell ye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Hiram certainly was busy enough these days. The early seeds were all\\r\\nin, however, and he had run the seed-harrow over the potato rows again,\\r\\nlengthwise, to keep the weeds out until the young plants should get a\\r\\nstart.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the raw winds and frosts at night, the potatoes had come up well\\r\\nand, with the steadily warming wind and sun, would now begin to grow.\\r\\nOther farmers\\' potatoes in the vicinity were not yet breaking the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly on Monday morning Henry Pollock appeared with bush-axe and\\r\\ngrubbing hoe, and Hiram shouldered similar tools and they started for\\r\\nthe river bottom. It was so far from the house that Mrs. Atterson agreed\\r\\nto send their dinner to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Father says he remembers seeing corn growing on this bottom,\" said\\r\\nHenry, as they set to work, \"so high that the ears were as high up as a\\r\\ntall man. It\\'s splendid corn land--if it don\\'t get flooded out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And does the river often over-ran its banks?\" queried Hiram, anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pretty frequent. It hasn\\'t yet this year; there wasn\\'t much snow last\\r\\nwinter, you see, and the early spring floods weren\\'t very high. But\\r\\nif we have a long wet spell, as we do have sometimes as late as July,\\r\\nyou\\'ll see water here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not very encouraging,\" said Hiram. \"Not for corn prospects, at\\r\\nleast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, corn\\'s our staple crop. You see, if you raise corn enough you\\'re\\r\\nsure of feed for your team. That\\'s the main point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But people with bigger farms than they have around here can raise corn\\r\\ncheaper than we can. They use machinery in harvesting it, too. Why not\\r\\nraise a better paying crop, and buy the extra corn you may need?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" responded Henry, shaking his head, \"nobody around here knows much\\r\\nabout raising fancy crops. I read about \\'em in the farm papers--oh, yes,\\r\\nwe take papers--the cheap ones. There is a lot of information in \\'em, I\\r\\nguess; but father don\\'t believe much that\\'s printed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Doesn\\'t believe much that\\'s printed?\" repeated Hiram, curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nope. He says it\\'s all lies, made up out of some man\\'s head. You see,\\r\\nwe useter take books out of the Sunday School library, and we had story\\r\\npapers, too; and father used to read \\'em as much as anybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But one summer we had a summer boarder--a man that wrote things. He\\r\\nhad one of these dinky little merchines with him that you play on like a\\r\\npiano, you know----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A typewriter?\" suggested Hiram, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yep. Well, he wrote stories. Father learnt as how all that stuff was\\r\\njust imaginary, and so he don\\'t take no stock in printed stuff any more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That man just sat down at that merchine, and rattled off a story that\\r\\nhe got real money for. It didn\\'t have to be true at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So father soured on it. And he says the stuff in the farm papers is\\r\\njust the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m afraid that your father is mistaken there,\" said Hiram, hiding\\r\\nhis amusement. \"Men who have spent years in studying agricultural\\r\\nconditions, and experimenting with soils, and seeds, and plants, and\\r\\nfertilizers, and all that, write what facts they have learned for our\\r\\nbetterment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No trade in the world is so encouraged and aided by Governments, and by\\r\\nprivate corporations, as the trade of farming. There is scarcely a State\\r\\nwhich does not have a special agricultural college in which there are\\r\\nwinter courses for people who cannot give the open time of the year to\\r\\npractical experiment on the college grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what you need in this locality, I guess,\" added Hiram. \"Some\\r\\nscientific farming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Book farming, father calls it,\" said Henry. \"And he says it\\'s no good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you save your money and take a course next winter in some\\r\\nside line and so be able to show him that he\\'s wrong?\" suggested Hiram.\\r\\n\"I want to do that myself after I have fulfilled my contract with Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t be able to do so next winter, for I shall be on wages. You\\'re\\r\\ngoing to be a farmer, aren\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I expect to. We\\'ve got a good farm as farms go around here. But it\\r\\nseems about all we can do to pay our fertilizer bills and get a living\\r\\noff it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why don\\'t you go about fitting yourself for your job?\" \"asked\\r\\nHiram. Be a good farmer--an up-to-date farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No fellow expects to be a machinist, or an electrician, or the like,\\r\\nwithout spending some time under good instructors. Most that I know\\r\\nabout soils, and fertilizers, and plant development, and the like, I\\r\\nlearned from my father, who kept abreast of the times by reading and\\r\\nexperiment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can stumble along, working at your trade of farming, and only half\\r\\nknowing it all your life; that\\'s what most farmers do, in fact. They are\\r\\ntoo lazy to take up the scientific side of it and learn why.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the point--learn why you do things that your father did, and his\\r\\nfather did, and his father before him. There\\'s usually good reason why\\r\\nthey did it--a scientific reason which somebody dug out by experiment\\r\\nages ago; but you ought to be able to tell why.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose that\\'s so,\" admitted Henry, as they worked on, side by side.\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t know what father would say if I sprung a college course on\\r\\nhim!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d find out,\" returned Hiram, laughing. \"You\\'d better spend your money\\r\\nthat way than for a horse and buggy. That\\'s the highest ambition of most\\r\\nboys in the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe labor of bushing and grubbing these acres of lowland was no light\\r\\none. Hiram insisted that every stub and root be removed that a heavy\\r\\nplow could not tear out. They had made some progress by noon, however,\\r\\nwhen Sister came down with their dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram built a campfire over which the coffee was re-heated, and the\\r\\nthree ate together, Sister enjoying the picnic to the full. She insisted\\r\\non helping in the work by piling the brush and roots into heaps for\\r\\nburning, and she remained until midafternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like that Henry boy,\" she confided to Hiram. \"He don\\'t pull my braids,\\r\\nor poke fun at me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Sister was developing and growing fast these days. She was putting\\r\\non flesh and color showed in her cheeks. They were no longer hollow and\\r\\nsallow, and she ran like a colt-and was almost as wild.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work of clearing the bottom land could not be continued daily; but\\r\\nthe boys got in three full days that week, and Saturday morning. Henry,\\r\\ndid not wish to work on Saturday afternoon, for in this locality almost\\r\\nall the farmers knocked off work at noon Saturday and went to town.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when Henry shouldered his tools to go home at noon, Sister appeared\\r\\nas usual with the lunch, and she and Hiram cut fishing rods and planned\\r\\nto have a real picnic.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrout and mullet were jumping in the pools under the bank; and they\\r\\ncaught several before stopping to eat their own meal. The freshly caught\\r\\nfish were a fine addition to the repast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went back to fishing after a while and caught enough for supper at\\r\\nthe farmhouse. Just as they were reeling up their lines the silence of\\r\\nthe place was disturbed by a strange sound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a motorcycle coming!\" cried Sister, jumping up and looking all\\r\\naround.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a bend in the river below this bottom, and another above; so\\r\\nthey could not see far in either direction unless they climbed to the\\r\\nhigh ground. For a minute Hiram could not tell in which direction the\\r\\nsound was coming; but he knew the steady put-put-put must be the exhaust\\r\\nof a motor-boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt soon poked its nose around the lower turn. It was a good-sized boat\\r\\nand instantly Hiram recognized at least one person aboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Lettie Bronson, in a very pretty boating costume, was in the bow.\\r\\nThere were half a dozen other girls with her--well dressed girls, who\\r\\nwere evidently her friends from the St. Beris school at Scoville.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, oh! what a pretty spot!\" cried Lettie, on the instant. \"We\\'ll go\\r\\nashore here and have our luncheon, girls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not see Hiram and Sister for a moment; but the latter tugged at\\r\\nHiram\\'s sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve seen that girl before,\" she whispered. \"She came in the carriage\\r\\nwith the man who spoke to you--you remember? She asked me if I had\\r\\nalways lived in the country, and how I tore my frock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t she pretty?\" returned Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Awfully. But I\\'m not sure that I like her yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Lettie saw Hiram and the girl beside him. She started, flushed\\r\\na little, and then gave Hiram a cool little nod and turned her gaze from\\r\\nhim. Her manner showed that he was not \"down in her good books,\" and the\\r\\nyoung fellow flushed in turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know as we\\'d better try to make the bank here, Miss,\" said the\\r\\nman who was directing the motor-boat. \"The current\\'s mighty sharp.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to land here,\" said Lettie, decidedly. \"It\\'s the prettiest spot\\r\\nwe\\'ve seen--isn\\'t it, girls?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer friends agreed. Hiram, casting a quick eye over the ruffled surface\\r\\nof the river, saw that the man was right. How well the stream below was\\r\\nfitted for motor-boating he did not know; but he was pretty sure that\\r\\nthere were too many ledges just under the surface here to make it safe\\r\\nfor the boat to go farther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I intend to land here-right by that big tree!\" commanded Lettie\\r\\nBronson, stamping her foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I dunno,\" drawled the man; and just then the bow of the boat\\r\\nswung around, was forced heavily down stream by the current, and slam it\\r\\nwent against a reef!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man shot off the engine instantly. The bow of the boat was lodged\\r\\non the rock, and tip-tilted considerably. The girls screamed, and Lettie\\r\\nherself was almost thrown into the water, for she was standing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII. MR. PEPPER APPEARS\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram noted again that Lettie Bronson did not display terror. While\\r\\nher friends were screaming and crying, she sat perfectly quiet, and for\\r\\na minute said never a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you back off?\" Hi heard her ask the boatman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not without lightening her, Miss. And she may have smashed a plank up\\r\\nthere, too. I dunno.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western girl turned immediately to Hiram, who had now come to the\\r\\nbank\\'s edge. She smiled at him charmingly, and her eyes danced. She\\r\\nevidently appreciated the fact that the young farmer had her at a\\r\\ndisadvantage--and she had meant to snub him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess you\\'ll have to help me again, Mr. Strong,\" she said. \"What will\\r\\nwe do? Can you push out a plank to us, or something?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m afraid not, Miss Bronson,\" he returned. \"I could cut a pole and\\r\\nreach it to the boat; but you girls couldn\\'t walk ashore on it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear! have we got to wade?\" cried one of Lettie\\'s friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t wade. It\\'s too deep between the shore and the boat,\" Hiram\\r\\nsaid, calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then--then we\\'ll stay here till the tide rises and dr-dr-drowns us!\"\\r\\nwailed another of the girls, giving way to sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be a goose, Myra Carroll!\" exclaimed Lettie. \"If you waited here\\r\\nfor the tide to rise you\\'d be gray-haired and decrepit. The tide doesn\\'t\\r\\nrise here. But maybe a spring flood would wash you away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that the frightened one sobbed harder than ever. She was one of\\r\\nthose who ever see the dark side of adventure. There was no hope on her\\r\\nhorizon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dunno what you can do for these girls,\" said the man. \"I\\'d git out\\r\\nand push off the boat, but I don\\'t dare with them aboard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram\\'s mind had not been inactive, if he was standing in seeming\\r\\nidleness. Sister tugged at his sleeve again and whispered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have they got to stay there and drown, Hi?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess not,\" he returned, slowly. \"Let\\'s see: this old sycamore\\r\\nleans right out over them. I can shin up there with the aid of the big\\r\\ngrapevine. Then, if I had a rope----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall I run and get one?\" demanded Sister, listening to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hullo!\" exclaimed Hiram, speaking to the man in the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\" asked the fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haven\\'t you got a coil of strong rope aboard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s the painter,\" said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Toss it ashore here,\" commanded Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Hiram Strong!\" cried Lettie. \"You don\\'t expect us to walk\\r\\ntightrope, do you?\" and she began to giggle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. I want you to unfasten the end of the rope. I want it clear--that\\'s\\r\\nit,\" said Hiram. \"And it\\'s long enough, I can see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For what?\" asked Sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait and you\\'ll see,\" returned the young farmer, hastily coiling the\\r\\nrope again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hung it over his shoulder and then started to climb the big sycamore.\\r\\nHe could go up the bole of this leaning tree very quickly, for the huge\\r\\ngrapevine gave him a hand-hold all the way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever are you going to do?\" cried Lettie Bronson, looking up at him,\\r\\nas did the other girls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said Hiram, in the first small crotch of the tree, which was\\r\\nalmost directly over the stranded launch, \"if you girls have any pluck\\r\\nat all, I can get you ashore, one by one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean for us to do, Hiram?\" repeated Lettie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young farmer quickly fashioned a noose at the end of the line--not a\\r\\nslipnoose, for that would tighten and hurt anybody bearing upon it. This\\r\\nhe dropped down to the boat and Lettie caught it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get your head and shoulders through that noose, Miss Bronson,\" he\\r\\ncommanded. \"Let it come under your arms. I will lift you out of the boat\\r\\nand swing you back and forth--there\\'s none of you so heavy that I can\\'t\\r\\ndo this, and if you wet your feet a little, what\\'s the odds?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear! I can never do that!\" squealed one of the other girls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Guess you\\'ll have to do it if you don\\'t want to stay here all night,\"\\r\\nreturned Lettie, promptly. \"I see what you want, Hiram,\" she added, and\\r\\nquickly adjusted the loop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, when you swing out over the bank, Sister will grab you, and steady\\r\\nyou. It will be all right if you have a care. Now!\" cried Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\nLettie Bronson showed no fear at all as he drew her up and she swung\\r\\nout of the boat over the swiftly-running current. Hiram laid along the\\r\\ntree-trunk in an easy position, and began swinging the girl at the end\\r\\nof the rope, like a pendulum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe river bank being at least three feet higher than the surface of the\\r\\nwater; he did not have to shift the rope again as he swung the girl back\\r\\nand forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister, clinging with her left hand to the grapevine, leaned forward and\\r\\nclutched Lettie\\'s hand. When she seized it, Sister backed away, and the\\r\\nswinging girl landed upright upon the bank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that\\'s fun!\" Lettie cried, laughing, loosing herself from \"the\\r\\nloop. Now you come, Mary Judson!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus encouraged they responded one by one, and even the girl who had\\r\\nbroken down and cried agreed to be rescued by this simple means. The\\r\\nboatman then, after removing his shoes and stockings and rolling up his\\r\\ntrousers, stepped out upon the sunken rock and pushed off the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was leaking badly. He dared not take aboard his passengers again,\\r\\nbut turned around and went down stream as fast as he could go so as to\\r\\nbeach the boat in a safe place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now how\\'ll we get back to Scoville?\" cried one of Lettie\\'s friends. \"I\\r\\ncan never walk that far.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSister had dropped back, shyly, behind Hiram, when he descended the\\r\\ntree. She had aided each girl ashore; but only Lettie had thanked her.\\r\\nNow she tugged at Hiram\\'s sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take \\'em home in our wagon,\" she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can take you to Scoville--or to Miss Bronson\\'s--in the farm wagon,\"\\r\\nHiram said, smiling. \"You can sit on straw in the bottom and be\\r\\ncomfortable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, a straw ride!\" cried Lettie. \"What fun! And he can drive us right\\r\\nto St. Beris--And think what the other girls will say and how they\\'ll\\r\\nstare!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea seemed a happy one to all the girls save the cry-baby, Myra\\r\\nCarroll. And her complaints were drowned in the laughter and chatter of\\r\\nthe others.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram picked up the tools, Sister got the string of fish, and they set\\r\\nout for the Atterson farmhouse. Lettie chatted most of the way with\\r\\nHiram; but to Sister, walking on the other side of the young farmer, the\\r\\nWestern girl never said a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the house it was the same. While Hiram was cleaning the wagon and\\r\\nputting a bed of straw into it, and currying the horse and gearing him\\r\\nto the wagon, Mrs. Atterson brought a crock of cookies out upon the\\r\\nporch and talked with the girls from St. Beris. Sister had run indoors\\r\\nand changed her shabby and soiled frock for a new gingham; but when she\\r\\ncame down to the porch, and stood bashfully in the doorway, none of the\\r\\ngirls from town spoke to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram drove up with the farm-wagon. Most of the girls had accepted the\\r\\nadventure in the true spirit now, and they climbed into the wagon-bed\\r\\non the clean straw with laughter and jokes. But nobody invited Sister to\\r\\njoin the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orphan looked wistfully after the wagon as Hiram drove out of\\r\\nthe yard. Then she turned, with trembling lip, to Mother Atterson:\\r\\n\"She--she\\'s awfully pretty,\" she said, \"and Hiram likes her. But\\r\\nshe--they\\'re all proud, and I guess they don\\'t think much of folks like\\r\\nus, after all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shucks, Sister! we\\'re just good as they be, every bit,\" returned Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson, bruskly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know; mebbe we be,\" admitted Sister, slowly. \"But it don\\'t feel so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd perhaps Hiram had some such thought, too, after he had driven the\\r\\ngirls to the big boarding school in Scoville. For they all got out\\r\\nwithout even thanking him or bidding him good-bye--all save Lettie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, we are a thousand times obliged to you, Hiram Strong,\" she\\r\\nsaid, in her very best manner, and offering him her hand. \"As the girls\\r\\nwere my guests I felt I must get them home again safely--and you were\\r\\nindeed a friend in need.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then she spoiled it utterly, by adding:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, how much do I owe you, Hiram?\" and took out her purse. \"Is two\\r\\ndollars enough?\" This put Hiram right in his place. He saw plainly that,\\r\\nfriendly as the Bronsons were, they did not look upon a common farm-boy\\r\\nas their equal--not in social matters, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could not take anything for doing a neighbor a favor, Miss Bronson,\"\\r\\nsaid Hiram, quietly. \"Thank you. Good-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram drove back home feeling quite as depressed as Sister, perhaps.\\r\\nFinally he said to himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, some day I\\'ll show \\'em!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that he put the matter out of his mind and refused to be troubled\\r\\nby thoughts of Lettie Bronson, or her attitude toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpring was advancing apace now. Every day saw the development of bud,\\r\\nleaf and plant. Slowly the lowland was cleared and the brush and roots\\r\\nwere heaped in great piles, ready for the torch.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram could not depend upon this six acres as their only piece of\\r\\ncorn, however. There was the four-acre lot between the barnyard and the\\r\\npasture in which he proposed to plant the staple crop.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew out the remainder of the coarse manure and spread it upon this\\r\\nland, as far as it would go. For enriching the remainder of the corn\\r\\ncrop he would have to depend upon a commercial fertilizer. He drew, too,\\r\\na couple of tons of lime to be used on this corn land, and left it in\\r\\nheaps to slake.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, out of the clear sky of their progress, came a bolt as\\r\\nunexpected as could be. They had been less than a month upon the farm.\\r\\nUncle Jeptha had not been in his grave thirty days, and Hiram was just\\r\\ngetting into the work of running the place, with success looming ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had refused Mr. Bronson\\'s offer of a position and had elected to\\r\\nstick by Mrs. Atterson. He had looked forward to nothing to disturb the\\r\\ncontract between them until the time should be fulfilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet one afternoon, while he was at work in the garden, Sister came out\\r\\nto him all in a flurry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mis\\' Atterson wants you! Mis\\' Atterson wants you!\" cried the girl. \"Oh,\\r\\nHiram! something dreadful\\'s going to happen. I know, by the way Mis\\'\\r\\nAtterson looks. And I don\\' like the looks o\\' that man that\\'s come to see\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram unhooked the horse at the end of the row and left Sister to lead\\r\\nhim to the stable. He went into the house after knocking the mud off his\\r\\nboots.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, sitting in the bright kitchen, was the sharp-featured,\\r\\nsnaky-looking man with whom Hiram had once talked in town. He knew his\\r\\nname was Pepper, and that he did something in the real estate line, and\\r\\ninsurance, and the like.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jest listen to what this man says, Hiram,\" said Mrs. Atterson, grimly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My name\\'s Pepper,\" began the man, eyeing Hiram curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I hear,\" returned the young farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Before old Mr. Atterson died we got to talking one day when he was in\\r\\ntown about his selling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\" returned Hiram. \"You didn\\'t say anything about that when you\\r\\noffered twelve hundred for this place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the man, stubbornly, \"that was a good offer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram turned to Mrs. Atterson. \"Do you want to sell for that price?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t, Hi,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then that settles it, doesn\\'t it? Mrs. Atterson is the owner, and she\\r\\nknows her own mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I made Uncle Jeptha a better offer,\" said Mr. Pepper, \"and I\\'ll make\\r\\nMrs. Atterson the same--sixteen hundred dollars. It\\'s a run-down farm,\\r\\nof course----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If Mrs. Atterson doesn\\'t want to sell,\" interrupted Hiram, but here his\\r\\nemployer intervened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s something more, Hi,\" she said, her face working \"strangely.\\r\\nTell him, you Pepper!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, the old man gave me an option on the place, and I risked a twenty\\r\\ndollar bill on it. The option had--er--a year to run; dated February\\r\\ntenth last; and I\\'ve decided to take the option up,\" said Mr. Pepper,\\r\\nhis shrewd little eyes dancing in their gaze from Hiram to the old lady\\r\\nand back again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII. A HEAVY CLOUD\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, a rattlesnake is poisonous, but he gives fair warning; a swamp\\r\\nmoccasin lies in wait for the unwary and strikes without sign or sound.\\r\\nInto Hiram Strong\\'s troubled mind came the thought that Mr. Pepper was\\r\\nstriking like his prototype of the swamps.\\r\\n\\r\\nA snaky sort of a man was Mr. Pepper--sly, a hand-rubber as he talked,\\r\\nwith a little, sickly grin playing about his thin, mean mouth. When he\\r\\nopened it Hiram almost expected to see a forked tongue run out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least, of one thing was the young farmer sure: Mr. Pepper was no more\\r\\nto be trusted than a serpent. Therefore, he did not take a word that the\\r\\nman said on trust.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe recovered from the shock which the statement of the real estate man\\r\\nhad caused, and he uttered no expression of either surprise, or trouble.\\r\\nMrs. Atterson he could see was vastly disturbed by the statement; but\\r\\nsomebody had to keep a cool bead in this matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let\\'s see your option,\" Hiram demanded, bruskly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why--if Mrs. Atterson wishes to see it----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You show it to Hi, you Pepper-man,\" snapped the old lady. \"I wouldn\\'t\\r\\ndo a thing without his advice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, well, if you consider a boy\\'s advice material----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know Hi\\'s honest,\" declared the old lady, tartly. \"And that\\'s what\\r\\nI\\'m sure you ain\\'t! Besides,\" she added, sadly, \"Hi\\'s as much interested\\r\\nin this thing as I be. If the farm\\'s got to be sold, it puts Hi out of a\\r\\njob.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, very well,\" said the real estate man, and he drew a rather soiled,\\r\\nfolded paper from his inner pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to hesitate the fraction of a second about showing the paper.\\r\\nIt increased Hi\\'s suspicion--this hesitancy. If the man had a perfectly\\r\\ngood option on the farm, why didn\\'t he go about the matter boldly?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he got the paper in his own hands he could see nothing wrong\\r\\nwith it. It seemed written in straight-forward language, the signatures\\r\\nwere clear enough, and as he had seen and read Uncle Jeptha\\'s will,\\r\\nhe was quite sure that this was the old man\\'s signature to the option\\r\\nwhich, for the sum of twenty dollars in hand paid to him, he agreed to\\r\\nsell his farm, situated so-and-so, for sixteen hundred dollars, cash,\\r\\nsame to be paid over within one year of date.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" said Hiram, slowly, handing back the paper--indeed, Pepper\\r\\nhad kept the grip of his forefinger and thumb on it all the time--\"Of\\r\\ncourse, Mrs. Atterson\\'s lawyer must see this before she agrees to\\r\\nanything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Hiram! I ain\\'t got no lawyer,\" exclaimed the old lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go to Mr. Strickland, who made Uncle Jeptha\\'s will,\" Hiram said to her.\\r\\nThen he turned to Pepper:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the name of the witness to that old man\\'s signature?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Abel Pollock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Henry\\'s father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. He\\'s got a son named Henry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who\\'s the Notary Public?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caleb Schell. He keeps the store just at the crossroads as you go into\\r\\ntown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember the store,\" said Hiram, thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Hiram!\" cried Mrs. Atterson, \"I don\\'t want to sell the farm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll be sure this paper is all straight before you do sell, Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I just won\\'t sell!\" she exclaimed. \"Uncle Jeptha never said\\r\\nnothing in his will about giving this option. And that lawyer says that\\r\\nin a couple of years the farm will be worth a good deal more than this\\r\\nPepper offers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Mrs. Atterson!\" exclaimed the real estate man, cheerfully, \"as\\r\\nproperty is selling in this locality now, sixteen hundred dollars is a\\r\\nmighty good offer for your farm. You ask anybody. Why, Uncle Jeptha knew\\r\\nit was; otherwise he wouldn\\'t have given me the option, for he didn\\'t\\r\\nbelieve I\\'d come up with the price. He knew it was a high offer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if it\\'s worth so much to you, why isn\\'t it worth more to Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson to keep?\" demanded Hiram, sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! that\\'s my secret--why I want it,\" said Pepper, nodding. \"Leave that\\r\\nto me. If I get bit by buying it, I shall have to suffer for my lack of\\r\\nwisdom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You ain\\'t bought it yet--you Pepper,\" snapped Mrs. Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I\\'m going to buy it, ma\\'am,\" replied he, rather viciously, as he\\r\\nstood up, ready to depart. \"I shall expect to hear from you no later\\r\\nthan Monday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t sell it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll have to. If you refuse to sign I\\'ll go to the Chancery Court.\\r\\nI\\'ll make you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well. Mebbe you will. But I don\\'t know. I never was made to do anything\\r\\nyet. By no man named Pepper--you can take that home with you,\" she flung\\r\\nafter him as he walked out and climbed into the buggy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whereas Mrs. Atterson showed anger, Hiram went back to work in the\\r\\nfield with a much deeper feeling racking his mind. If the option was all\\r\\nright--and of course it must be--this would settle their occupancy of\\r\\nthe farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course he could not hold Mrs. Atterson to her contract. She could not\\r\\nhelp the situation that had now arisen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis Spring\\'s work had gone for nothing. Sixteen hundred dollars, even in\\r\\ncash, would not be any great sum for the old lady. And she had burdened\\r\\nherself with the support of Sister--and with Old Lem Camp, too!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely, I can\\'t be a burden on her. I\\'ll have to hustle around and find\\r\\nanother job. I wonder if Mr. Bronson would take me on now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he knew that the Westerner already had a man who suited him, since\\r\\nHiram had refused the chance Bronson offered. And, then, Lettie had\\r\\nshown that she felt he had not appreciated their offer. Perhaps her\\r\\nfather felt the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, Hiram had a secret wish not to put himself under obligation\\r\\nto the Bronsons. This feeling may have sprung from a foolish source;\\r\\nnevertheless it was strong with the young farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt looked very much to him as though this sudden turn of circumstances\\r\\nwas \"a facer\". If Mrs. Atterson had to sell the farm he was likely to be\\r\\nthrown on his own resources again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his own selfish sake Hiram was worried, too. After all, he would\\r\\nbe unable to \"make good\" and to show people that he could make the old,\\r\\nrun-down farm pay a profit to its owner.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram Strong couldn\\'t believe it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more he milled over the thing in his mind, the less he understood\\r\\nwhy Uncle Jeptha, who was of acute mind right up to the hour of his\\r\\ndeath, so all the neighbors said, should have neglected to speak about\\r\\nthe option he had given Pepper on the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here they were, right in the middle of the Spring work, with crops\\r\\nin the ground and--as Mrs. Atterson agreed--it would be too late to go\\r\\nhunting a farm for this present season.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram kept to work. He had Sister and Old Lem Camp out in the\\r\\ngarden, hand-weeding and thinning the carrots, onions, and other tender\\r\\nplants. That Saturday he went through the entire garden--that part\\r\\nalready planted--with either the horse cultivator, or his wheel-hoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn planting parsnips, carrots, and other slow-germinating seeds, he had\\r\\nmixed a few radish seed in the seeding machine; these sprang up quickly\\r\\nand defined the rows, so that the space between rows could be cultivated\\r\\nbefore the other plants had scarcely broke the surface of the soil.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow these radish were beginning to be big enough to pull. Hiram brought\\r\\nin a few bunches for their dinner on Saturday--the first fruits of the\\r\\ngarden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, I dunno why it is,\" said Mrs. Atterson, complacently, after\\r\\nsetting her teeth in the first radish and relishing its crispness,\\r\\n\"but this seems a whole lot better than the radishes we used to buy in\\r\\nCrawberry. I \\'spect what\\'s your very own always seems better than other\\r\\nfolks\\'s,\" and she sighed and shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was thinking of the thing she had to face on Monday. Hiram hated to\\r\\nsee them all so downhearted. Sister\\'s eyes were red from weeping; Old\\r\\nLem Camp sat at the table, muttering and playing with his food again\\r\\ninstead of eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram felt as though he could not give up to the disaster that had\\r\\ncome to them. The thought that--in some way--Pepper was taking an unfair\\r\\nadvantage of Mother Atterson knocked continually at the door of his\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went over, to himself, all that had passed in the kitchen the day\\r\\nbefore when the real estate man had come to speak with Mrs. Atterson.\\r\\nHow had Pepper spoken about the option? Hadn\\'t there been some hesitancy\\r\\nin the fellow\\'s manner--in his speech, indeed? Just what had Pepper\\r\\nsaid? Hiram concentrated his mind upon this one thing. What had the man\\r\\nsaid?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The option had--er--one year to run.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThose were the fellow\\'s very words. He hesitated before he pronounced\\r\\nthe length of time. And he was not a man who, in speaking, had any\\r\\nstammering of tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy had he hesitated? Why should it trouble him to state the time limit\\r\\nof the option?\\r\\n\\r\\nWas it because he was speaking a falsehood?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought stung Hiram like a thorn in the flesh. He put away the tool\\r\\nwith which he was working, slipped on a coat, and started for Henry\\r\\nPollock\\'s house, which lay not more than half a mile from the Atterson\\r\\nfarm, across the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX. THE REASON WHY\\r\\n\\r\\nHIRAM found Abel Pollock mending harness in the shed. Hiram opened his\\r\\nbusiness bluntly, and told the farmer what was up. Mr. Pollock scratched\\r\\nhis head, listened attentively, and then sat down to digest the news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You gotter move--jest when you\\'ve got rightly settled on that place?\"\\r\\nhe demanded. \"Well, that\\'s \\'tarnal bad! And from what Henry tells me,\\r\\nyou\\'re a young feller with idees, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care so much for myself,\" Hiram hastened to say. \"It\\'s Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson I\\'m thinking about. And she had just made up her mind that she\\r\\nwas anchored for the rest of her life. Besides, I don\\'t think it is a\\r\\nwise thing to sell the property at that price.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. I wouldn\\'t sell if I was her, for no sixteen hundred dollars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she\\'s got to, you see, Mr. Pollock. Pepper has the option signed by\\r\\nher Uncle Jeptha----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jeptha Atterson was no fool,\" interrupted Pollock. \"I can\\'t understand\\r\\nhis giving an option on the farm, with all this talk of the railroad\\r\\ncrossing the river.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Mr. Pollock!\" exclaimed Hiram, eagerly, \"you must know all about\\r\\nthis option. You signed as a witness to Uncle Jeptha\\'s signature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! you don\\'t mean that?\" exclaimed the farmer. \"My name to it, too?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. And it was signed before Caleb Schell the notary public.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So it was--so it was, boy!\" declared the other, suddenly smiting his\\r\\nknee. \"I remember I witnessed Uncle Jeptha\\'s signature once. But that\\r\\nwas way back there in the winter--before he was took sick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir?\" said Hiram, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was an option on the old farm. So it was. But goodness me, boy,\\r\\nPepper must have got him to renew it, or something. That option wouldn\\'t\\r\\nhave run till now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram told him the date the paper was executed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, by Jo! It was in February.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it was for a year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pollock stared at him in silence, evidently thinking deeply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you remember all about it, then,\" Hiram continued, \"it\\'s hardly\\r\\nworth while going to Mr. Schell, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember, all right,\" said Pollock, slowly. \"It was all done right\\r\\nthere in Cale Schell\\'s store. It was one rainy afternoon. There was\\r\\nseveral of us sitting around Cale\\'s stove. Pepper was one of us. In\\r\\ncomes Uncle Jeptha. Pepper got after him right away, but sort of on the\\r\\nquiet, to one side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard \\'em. Pepper had made him an offer for the farm that was \\'way\\r\\ndown low, and the old man laughed at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We hadn\\'t none of us heard then the talk that came later about the\\r\\nrailroad. But Pepper has a brother-in-law who\\'s in the office of the\\r\\ncompany, and he thinks he gits inside information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, for some reason, he thought the railroad was going to touch\\r\\nUncle Jeptha\\'s farm. O\\' course, it ain\\'t. It\\'s goin\\' over the river by\\r\\nAyertown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see what Pepper wants to take up the option for, anyway. Unless\\r\\nhe sees that you\\'re likely to make suthin\\' out o\\' the old place, and\\r\\nmebbe he\\'s got a city feller on the string, to buy it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter what his reason is. Mrs. Atterson doesn\\'t want to\\r\\nsell, and if that option is all right, she must,\" said Hiram. \"And you\\r\\nare sure Uncle Jeptha gave it for twelve months?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twelve months?\" ejaculated Pollock, suddenly. \"Why--no--that don\\'t seem\\r\\nright,\" stammered the farmer, scratching his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that\\'s the way the option reads.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--mebbe. I didn\\'t just read it myself--no, sir. They jest says to\\r\\nme:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Come here, Pollock, and witness these signatures\\' So, I done\\r\\nit--that\\'s all. But I see Cale put on his specs and read the durn thing\\r\\nthrough before he stamped it. Yes, sir. Cale\\'s the carefulest notary\\r\\npublic we ever had around here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say!\" said Mr. Pollock. \"You go to Cale and ask him. It don\\'t seem to\\r\\nme the old man give Pepper so long a time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For how long was the option to run, then?\" queried Hiram, excitedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wal, I wouldn\\'t wanter say. I don\\'t wanter git inter trouble with no\\r\\nneighbor. If Cale says a year is all right, then I\\'ll say so, too. I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t jest trust my memory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there is some doubt in your mind, Mr. Pollock?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is. A good deal of doubt,\" the farmer assured him. \"But you ask\\r\\nCale.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all that Hiram could get out of the elder Pollock. It was not\\r\\nvery comforting. The young farmer was of two minds whether he should see\\r\\nCaleb Schell, or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he got back to the house for supper, and saw the doleful faces\\r\\nof the three waiting there, he couldn\\'t stand inaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you don\\'t mind, I want to go to town tonight, Mrs. Atterson,\" he\\r\\ntold the old lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, Hiram. I expect you\\'ve got to look out for yourself, boy.\\r\\nIf you can get another job, you take it. It\\'s a \\'tarnal shame you didn\\'t\\r\\ntake up with that Bronson\\'s offer when he come here after you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You needn\\'t feel so,\" said Hiram. \"You\\'re no more at fault than I am.\\r\\nThis thing just happened--nobody could foretell it. And I\\'m just as\\r\\nsorry as I can be for you, Mother Atterson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman wiped her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Hi, there\\'s other things in this world to worry over besides\\r\\ngravy, I find,\" she said. \"Some folks is born for trouble, and mebbe\\r\\nwe\\'re some of that kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not exactly Mr. Pollock\\'s doubts that sent Hiram Strong down\\r\\nto the crossroads store that evening. For the farmer had seemed so\\r\\nuncertain that the boy couldn\\'t trust to his memory at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. It was Hiram\\'s remembrance of Pepper\\'s stammering when he spoke\\r\\nabout the option. He hesitated to pronounce the length of time the\\r\\noption had been drawn for. Was it because he knew there was some trick\\r\\nabout the time-limit?\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the real estate man fooled old Uncle Jeptha in the beginning? The\\r\\ndead man had been very shrewd and careful. Everybody said so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was conscious and of acute mind right up to his death. If there was\\r\\nan option on the farm be surely would have said something about it to\\r\\nMr. Strickland, or to some of the neighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt looked to Hiram as though the old farmer must have believed that the\\r\\noption had expired before the day of his death.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Pepper only got the old man\\'s promise for a shorter length of time,\\r\\nbut substituted the paper reading \"one year\" when it was signed? Was\\r\\nthat the mystery?\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Hiram could not see how that would help Mrs. Atterson, for even\\r\\ntestimony of witnesses who heard the discussion between the dead man and\\r\\nthe real estate agent, could not controvert a written instrument. The\\r\\nyoung fellow knew that.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe harnessed the old horse to the light wagon and drove to the\\r\\ncrossroads store kept by Caleb Schell. Many of the country people liked\\r\\nto trade with this man because his store was a social gathering-place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround a hot stove in the winter, and a cold stove at this time of year,\\r\\nthe men gathered to discuss the state of the country, local politics,\\r\\ntheir neighbors\\' business, and any other topic which was suggested to\\r\\ntheir more or less idle minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the outskirts of the group of older loafers, the growing crop of men\\r\\nwho would later take their places in the soap-box forum lingered; while\\r\\nsky-larking about the verge of the crowd were smaller boys who were\\r\\nlearning no good, to say the least, in attaching themselves to the older\\r\\nmembers of the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere will always be certain men in every community who take delight in\\r\\npoisoning the minds of the younger generation. We muzzle dogs, or shoot\\r\\nthem when they go mad. The foul-mouthed man is far more vicious than the\\r\\ndog, and should be impounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram hitched his horse to the rack before the store and entered the\\r\\ncrowded place. The fumes of tobacco smoke, vinegar, cheese, and various\\r\\nother commodities gave a distinctive flavor to Caleb Schell\\'s store--and\\r\\nnot a pleasant one, to Hiram\\'s mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdinarily he would have made any purchases he had to make, and gone out\\r\\nat once. But Schell was busy with several customers at the counter and\\r\\nhe was forced to wait a chance to speak with the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first persons Hiram saw in the store was young Pete\\r\\nDickerson, hanging about the edge of the crowd. Pete scowled at him and\\r\\nmoved away. One of the men holding down a cracker-keg sighted Hiram and\\r\\nhailed him in a jovial tone:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hi, there, Mr. Strong! What\\'s this we been hearin\\' about you? They\\r\\nsay you had a run-in with Sam Dickerson. We been tryin\\' to git the\\r\\npertic\\'lars out o\\' Pete, here, but he don\\'t seem ter wanter talk about\\r\\nit,\" and the man guffawed heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hear ye made Sam give back the tools he borrowed of the old man?\" said\\r\\nanother man, whom Hiram knew to be Mrs. Larriper\\'s son-in-law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are probably misinformed,\" said Hiram, quietly. \"I know no reason\\r\\nwhy Mr. Dickerson and I should have trouble--unless other neighbors make\\r\\ntrouble for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Right, boy--right!\" called Cale Schell, from behind the counter, where\\r\\nhe could hear and comment upon all that went on in the middle of the\\r\\nroom, despite the attention he had to give to his customers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, if you can git along with Sam and Pete, you\\'ll do well,\" laughed\\r\\nanother of the group.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dickersons seemed to be in disfavor in the community, and nobody\\r\\ncared whether Pete repeated what was said to his father, or not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was told,\" pursued the first speaker, screwing up one eye and\\r\\ngrinning at Hiram, \"that you broke Sam\\'s gun over his head and chased\\r\\nPete a mile. That right, son?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will get no information from me,\" returned Hiram, tartly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Pete ought to be big enough to lick you alone, Strong,\" continued\\r\\nthe tantalizer. \"Hey, Pete! Don\\'t sneak out. Come and tell us why you\\r\\ndidn\\'t give this chap the lickin\\' you said you was going to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPete only glared at him and slunk out of the store. Hiram turned his\\r\\nback on the whole crowd and waited at the end of the counter for Mr.\\r\\nSchell. The storekeeper was a tall, portly man, with a gray mustache and\\r\\nside-whiskers, and a high bald forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I do for you, Mr. Strong?\" he asked, finally having got rid of\\r\\nthe customers who preceded Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram, in a low voice, explained his mission. Schell nodded his head at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" he said; \"I remember about the option. I had forgotten it,\\r\\nfor a fact; but Pepper was in here yesterday talking about it. He had\\r\\nbeen to your house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, sir, to the best of your remembrance, the option is all right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, certainly! Pollock witnessed it, and I put my seal on it. Yes, sir;\\r\\nPepper can make the old lady sell. It\\'s too bad, if she wants to remain\\r\\nthere; but the price he is to pay isn\\'t so bad----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no reason to doubt the validity of the option?\" cried Hiram,\\r\\nin desperation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Assuredly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why didn\\'t Uncle Jeptha speak of it to somebody before he died, if\\r\\nthe option had not run out at that time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Humph!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You grant the old man was of sound mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sound as a pine knot,\" agreed the storekeeper, still reflective.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then how is it he did not speak to his lawyer about the option when he\\r\\nsaw Mr. Strickland within an hour of his death?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That does seem peculiar,\" admitted the storekeeper, slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Mr. Pollock says he thinks there is something wrong about the\\r\\noption,\" went on Hiram, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Pollock! Pah!\" returned Schell. \"I don\\'t suppose he even read it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you did?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Assuredly. I always read every paper. If they don\\'t want me to know\\r\\nwhat the agreement is, they can take it to some other Notary,\" declared\\r\\nthe storekeeper with a jolly laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you are sure that the option was to run a year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course the option\\'s all right--Hold on! A year, did you say?\\r\\nWhy--seems to me--let\\'s look this thing up,\" concluded Caleb Schell,\\r\\nsuddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dived into his little office and produced a ledger from the safe.\\r\\nThis he slapped down on the counter between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m a careful man, I am,\" he told Hiram. \"And I flatter myself I\\'ve got\\r\\na good memory, too. Pepper was in here yesterday sputtering about the\\r\\noption and I remember now that he spoke of its running a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it seems to me,\" said Schell, pawing over the leaves of his ledger,\\r\\n\"that the talk between him and old Uncle Jeptha was for a short time.\\r\\nThe old man was mighty cautious--mighty cautious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what Mr. Pollock says,\" cried Hiram, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you\\'ve seen the option?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it reads a year?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then how you going to get around that?\" demanded Schell, with\\r\\nconviction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps Uncle Jeptha signed the option thinking it was for a\\r\\nshorter time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That wouldn\\'t help you none. The paper was signed. And why should\\r\\nPepper have buncoed him--at that time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should he be so eager to get the farm now?\" asked Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll tell you. It ain\\'t out yet. But two or three days ago the\\r\\nrailroad board abandoned the route through Ayertown and it is agreed\\r\\nthat the new bridge will be built along there by your farm somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The river is as narrow there as it is anywhere for miles up and down,\\r\\nand they will stretch a bridge from the high bank on your side, across\\r\\nthe meadows, to the high bank on the other side. It will cut out grades,\\r\\nyou see. That\\'s what has started Pepper up to grab off the farm while\\r\\nthe option is valid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Mr. Schell, is the option valid?\" cried Hiram, anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see how you\\'re going to get around it. Ah! here\\'s the place.\\r\\nWhen I have sealed a paper I make a note of it--what the matter was\\r\\nabout and who the contracting parties were. I\\'ve done that for years.\\r\\nLet--me--see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe adjusted his spectacles. He squinted at the page, covered closely\\r\\nwith writing. Hiram saw him whispering the words he read to himself.\\r\\nSuddenly the blood flooded into the old man\\'s face, and he looked up\\r\\nwith a start at his interrogator.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to say that option\\'s for a year? he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the way it reads--now,\" whispered Hiram, watching him closely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man turned the book around slowly on the counter. His stubbed\\r\\nfinger pointed to the two or three scrawled lines written in a certain\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram read them slowly, with beating heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX. AN ENEMY IN THE DARK\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whispered conference between Hiram Strong and the storekeeper could\\r\\nnot be heard by the curious crowd around the cold stove; nor did it last\\r\\nfor long.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaleb Schell finally closed his ledger and put it away. Hiram shook\\r\\nhands with him and walked out.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the platform outside, which was illuminated by a single smoky\\r\\nlantern, a group of small boys were giggling, and they watched Hiram\\r\\nunhitch the old horse and climb into the spring wagon with so much\\r\\nhilarity that the young farmer expected some trick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horse started off all right, he missed nothing from the wagon, and\\r\\nso he supposed that he was mistaken. The boys had merely been laughing\\r\\nat him because he was a stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as Hiram got some few yards from the hitching rack, the seat was\\r\\nsuddenly pulled from under him, and he was left sprawling on his back in\\r\\nthe bottom of the wagon.\\r\\n\\r\\nA yell of derision from the crowd outside the store assured him that\\r\\nthis was the cause of the boys\\' hilarity. Luckily his old horse was of\\r\\nquiet disposition, and he stopped dead in his tracks when the seat flew\\r\\nout of the back of the wagon.\\r\\n\\r\\nA joke is a joke. No use in showing wrath over this foolish amusement of\\r\\nthe crossroads boys. But Hiram got a little the best of them, after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngsters had scattered when the \"accident\" occurred. Hiram,\\r\\ngetting out to pick up the seat, found the end of a strong hemp line\\r\\nfastened to it. The other end was tied to the hitching rack in front of\\r\\nthe store.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of casting off the line from the seat, Hiram walked back to the\\r\\nstore and cast that end off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At any rate, I\\'m in a good coil of hemp rope,\" he said to one of the\\r\\nmen who had come out to see the fun. \"The fellow who owns it can come\\r\\nand prove property; but I shall ask a few questions of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no more laughter. The young farmer walked back to his wagon,\\r\\nset up the seat again, and drove on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roadway was dark, but having been used all his life to country\\r\\nroads at night, Hiram had no difficulty in seeing the path before him.\\r\\nBesides, the old horse knew his way home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drove on some eighth of a mile. Suddenly he felt that the wagon\\r\\nwas not running true. One of the wheels was yawing. He drew in the old\\r\\nhorse; but he was not quick enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nigh forward wheel rolled off the end of the axle, and down came the\\r\\nwagon with a crash!\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram was thrown forward and came sprawling--on hands and knees--upon\\r\\nthe ground, while the wheel rolled into the ditch. He was little hurt,\\r\\nalthough the accident might have been serious.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in truth, he knew it to be no accident. A burr does not easily work\\r\\noff the end of an axle. He had greased the old wagon just before he\\r\\nstarted for the store, and he knew he had replaced each nut carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a deliberately malicious trick--no boy\\'s joke like the tying of\\r\\nthe rope to his wagon seat. And the axle was broken. Although he had\\r\\nno lantern he could see that the wagon could not be used again without\\r\\nbeing repaired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who did it?\" was Hiram\\'s unspoken question, as he slowly unharnessed\\r\\nthe old horse, and then dragged the broken wagon entirely out of the\\r\\nroad so that it would not be an obstruction for other vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mind set instantly upon Pete Dickerson. He had not seen the boy\\r\\nwhen he came out of the crossroads store. If the fellow had removed this\\r\\nburr, he had done it without anybody seeing him, and had then run home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young farmer, much disturbed over this incident, mounted the back\\r\\nof the old horse, and paced home. He only told Mrs. Atterson that he had\\r\\nmet with an accident and that the light wagon would have to be repaired\\r\\nbefore it could be used again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat necessitated their going to town on Monday in the heavy wagon. And\\r\\nHiram dragged the spring wagon to the blacksmith shop for repairs, on\\r\\nthe way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before that, the enemy in the dark had struck again. When Hiram\\r\\nwent to the barnyard to water the stock, Sunday morning, he found that\\r\\nsomebody had been bothering the pump.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bucket, or pump-valve, was gone. He had to take it apart, cut a new\\r\\nvalve out of sole leather, and put the pump together again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll have to get a cross dog, if we remain here,\" he told Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson. \"There is somebody in the neighborhood who means us harm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Them Dickersons!\" exclaimed Mrs. Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps. That Pete, maybe. If I once caught him up to his tricks I\\'d\\r\\nmake him sorry enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell the constable, Hi,\" cried Sister, angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would make trouble for his folks. Maybe they don\\'t know just how\\r\\nmean Pete is. A good thrashing--and the threat of another every time he\\r\\ndid anything mean--would do him lots more good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wasn\\'t nice Sunday work, but it was too far to carry water from the\\r\\nhouse to the horse trough, so Hiram had to repair the pump.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday morning he routed out Sister and Mr. Camp at daybreak. He had\\r\\nbeen up and out for an hour himself, and on a bench under the shed he\\r\\nhad heaped two or three bushels of radishes which he had pulled and\\r\\nwashed, ready for bunching.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe showed his helpers how the pretty scarlet balls were to be bunched,\\r\\nand found that Sister took hold of the work with nimble fingers, while\\r\\nMr. Camp did very well at the unaccustomed task.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, Hi,\" said Mrs. Atterson, despondently, \"that it\\'s worth\\r\\nwhile your trying to sell any of the truck, if we\\'re going to leave here\\r\\nso soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We haven\\'t left yet,\" he returned, trying to speak cheerfully. \"And you\\r\\nmight as well get every penny back that you can. Perhaps an arrangement\\r\\ncan be made whereby we can stay and harvest the garden crop, at any\\r\\nrate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can make up your mind that that Pepper man won\\'t give us any\\r\\nleeway; he isn\\'t that kind,\" declared Mother Atterson, with conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram made a quick sale of the radishes at several of the stores, where\\r\\nhe got eighteen cents a dozen bunches; but some he sold at the big\\r\\nboarding-school--St. Beris--at a retail price.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can bring any other fresh vegetables you may have from time\\r\\nto time,\" the housekeeper told him. \"Nobody ever raised any early\\r\\nvegetables about Scoville before. They are very welcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Once we get a-going,\" said Hiram to Mrs. Atterson, \"you or Sister can\\r\\ndrive in with the spring wagon and dispose of the surplus vegetables.\\r\\nAnd you might get a small canning outfit--they come as cheap as fifteen\\r\\ndollars--and put up tomatoes, corn, peas, beans, and other things. Good\\r\\ncanned stuff always sells well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Land o\\' Goshen, Hiram!\" exclaimed the old lady, in desperation.\\r\\n\"You talk jest as though we were going to stay on the farm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let\\'s go and see Mr. Strickland,\" replied the young farmer, and\\r\\nthey set out for the lawyer\\'s office.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson sat in the ante-room while Hiram asked to speak with the\\r\\nold lawyer in private for a minute. The conference was not for long, and\\r\\nwhen Hiram came back to his employer he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Strickland has sent his junior clerk out for Pepper. He thinks we\\'d\\r\\nbetter talk the matter over quietly. And he wants to see the option,\\r\\ntoo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Hiram! There ain\\'t no hope, is there?\" groaned the old lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I tell you what!\" exclaimed the young fellow, \"we won\\'t give in\\r\\nto him until we have to. Of course, if you refuse to sign a deed he\\r\\ncan go to chancery and in the end you will have to pay the costs of the\\r\\naction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps, even at that, it might be well to hold him off until you\\r\\nhave got the present crop out of the ground.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I won\\'t go to law,\" said Mrs. Atterson, decidedly. \"No good ever\\r\\ncome of that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time Mr. Strickland invited them both into his private office.\\r\\nThe attorney spoke quietly of other matters while they waited for\\r\\nPepper.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the real estate man did not appear. By and by Mr. Strickland\\'s clerk\\r\\ncame back with the report that Pepper had been called away suddenly on\\r\\nimportant business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They tell me he went Saturday,\" said the clerk. \"He may not be back\\r\\nfor a week. But he said he was going to buy the Atterson place when he\\r\\nreturned--he\\'s told several people around town so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Strickland, slowly. \"Then he has left that threat\\r\\nhanging, like the Sword of Damocles--over Mrs. Atterson\\'s head?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know nothin\\' about that sword, Mr. Strickland, nor no\\r\\nother sword, \\'cept a rusty one that my father carried when he was a\\r\\nhoss-sodger in the Rebellion,\" declared Mother Atterson, nervously. \"But\\r\\nif that Pepper man\\'s got one belonging to Mr. Damocles, I shouldn\\'t be\\r\\nat all surprised. That Pepper looked to me like a man that would take\\r\\nanything he could lay his hands on--if he warn\\'t watched!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which is a true and just interpretation of Pepper\\'s character, I\\r\\nbelieve,\" observed the lawyer, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And we\\'ve got to give up the farm at his say-so--at any time?\" demanded\\r\\nthe old lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If his option is good,\" said Mr. Strickland. \"But I want to see the\\r\\npaper--and I can assure you, Mrs. Atterson, that I shall subject it to\\r\\nthe closest possible scrutiny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a possibility that Pepper\\'s option may be questioned before\\r\\nthe courts. Do not build too many hopes on this,\" he added, quickly,\\r\\nseeing the old lady\\'s face light up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a very good champion in this young man,\" and the lawyer nodded\\r\\nat Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He suspected all was not right with the option and he has dug up the\\r\\nfact that the witness to your uncle\\'s signature, and the man before whom\\r\\nthe paper was attested, both believed the option was for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caleb Schell\\'s book shows that it was for thirty days. Uncle Jeptha\\r\\nundoubtedly thought it was for that length of time and therefore the\\r\\noption expired several days before he died.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Pepper may have fallen under temptation. He considered heretofore,\\r\\nlike everybody else, that the railroad would pass us by in this section.\\r\\nPepper gambled twenty dollars on its coming along the boundary of the\\r\\nAtterson farm--between you and Darrell\\'s tract--and thought he had lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then suddenly the railroad board turned square around and voted for the\\r\\ncondemnation of the original route. Pepper remembered the option he had\\r\\nrisked twenty dollars on. If it was originally for thirty days, it was\\r\\nvoid, of course; but Uncle Jeptha is dead, and he hopes perhaps, that\\r\\nnobody else will dispute the validity of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a forgery, then?\" cried Mrs. Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may be a forgery. We do not know,\" said the lawyer, hastily. \"At any\\r\\nrate, he has the paper, and he is a shrewd rascal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson\\'s face was a study.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to tell me we have got to lose the farm?\" she demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear lady, that I cannot tell you. I must see this option. We must\\r\\nput it to the test----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Schell and Pollock will testify that the option was for thirty\\r\\ndays,\" cried Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps. To the best of their remembrance and belief, it was for\\r\\nthirty days. A shrewd lawyer, however--and Pepper would employ a shrewd\\r\\none--would turn their evidence inside out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No evidence--in theory, at least--can controvert a written instrument,\\r\\nsigned, sealed, and delivered. Even Cale Schell\\'s memoranda book cannot\\r\\nbe taken as evidence, save in a contributory way. It is not direct. It\\r\\nis the carelessly scribbled record, in pencil, of a busy man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. If Pepper puts forward the option we have got to see if that\\r\\noption has been tampered with--the paper itself, I mean. If the fellow\\r\\nsubstituted a different instrument, at the time of signing, from the one\\r\\nUncle Jeptha thought he signed, you have no case--I tell you frankly, my\\r\\ndear lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, it ain\\'t no use. We got to lose the place, Hiram,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson, when they left the lawyer\\'s office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t lose heart. If Pepper is scared, he may not trouble you\\r\\nagain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s got ten months more to run,\" said she. \"He can keep us guessin\\' all\\r\\nthat time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is so,\" agreed Hiram, nodding thoughtfully. \"But, of course, as\\r\\nMr. Strickland says, by raising a doubt as to the validity of the option\\r\\nwe can hold him off for a while--maybe until we have made this year\\'s\\r\\ncrop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s goin\\' to make me lay awake o\\' nights,\" sighed the old lady. \"And\\r\\nI thought I\\'d got through with that when I stopped worryin\\' about the\\r\\ngravy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, we won\\'t talk about next year,\" agreed Hiram. \"I\\'ll do the best I\\r\\ncan for you through this season, if Pepper will let us alone. We\\'ve got\\r\\nthe bottom land practically cleared; we might as well plough it and put\\r\\nin the corn there. If we make a crop you\\'ll get all your money back and\\r\\nmore. Mr. Strickland told me privately that the option, unless it read\\r\\nthat way, would not cover the crops in the ground. And I read the option\\r\\ncarefully. Crops were not mentioned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it was decided to go ahead with the work as already planned;\\r\\nbut neither the young farmer, nor his employer, could look forward\\r\\ncheerfully to the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe uncertainty of what Pepper would eventually do was bound to be in\\r\\ntheir thought, day and night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI. THE WELCOME TEMPEST\\r\\n\\r\\nTo some youths this matter of the option would have been such a clog\\r\\nthat they would have lost interest and slighted the work. But not so\\r\\nwith Hiram Strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe counted this day a lost one, however; he hated to leave the farm for\\r\\na minute when there was so much to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the next morning he got the plow into the four-acre corn lot; and\\r\\nhe did nothing but the chores that week until the ground was entirely\\r\\nplowed. Then Henry Pollock came over and gave him another day\\'s work and\\r\\nthey finished grubbing the lowland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rubbish was piled in great heaps down there, ready for burning. As\\r\\nlong as the rain held off, Hiram did not put fire to the bush-heaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut early in the following week the clouds began to gather in a quarter\\r\\nfor rain, and late in the afternoon, when the air was still, he took a\\r\\ncan of coal oil, and with Sister and Mr. Camp, and even Mrs. Atterson,\\r\\nat his heels, went down to the riverside to burn the brush heaps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s not much danger of the fire spreading to the woods; but if it\\r\\nshould,\" Hiram said, warningly, \"it might, at this time of year, do your\\r\\ntimber a couple of hundred dollars\\' worth of damage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Goodness me!\" exclaimed Mother Atterson. \"It does seem ridiculous to\\r\\nhear you talk that a-way. I never owned nothin\\' but a little bit of\\r\\nfurniture before, and I expected the boarders to tear that all to\\r\\npieces. I\\'m beginning to feel all puffed up and wealthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram cut them all green pineboughs for beaters, and then set the fires,\\r\\none after another. There were more than twenty of the great piles and\\r\\nsoon the river bottom, from bend to bend, was filled with rolling clouds\\r\\nof smoke. As the dusk dropped, the yellow glare of the fire illuminated\\r\\nthe scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister clapped her hands and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ain\\'t this bully? It beats the Fourth of July celebration in Crawberry.\\r\\nOh, I\\'d rather be on the farm than go to heaven!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had brought their supper with them, and leaving the others to watch\\r\\nthe fires, and see that the grass did not tempt the flames to the edge\\r\\nof the wood, Hiram cast bait into the river and, in an hour, drew out\\r\\nenough mullet and \"bull-heads\" to satisfy them all, when they were\\r\\nbroiled over the hot coals of the first bonfire to be lighted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey ate with much enjoyment. Between nine and ten o\\'clock the fires had\\r\\nall burned down to coals.\\r\\n\\r\\nA circle of burned-over grass and rubbish surrounded each fire. There\\r\\nseemed no possibility that the flames could spread to the mat of dry\\r\\nleaves on the side hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went home, a lantern guiding their feet over the rough path\\r\\nthrough the timber, stopping at the spring for a long, thirst-quenching\\r\\ndraught.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky was as black as ink. Now and again a faint flash in the westward\\r\\nproclaimed a tempest in that direction. But not a breath of wind was\\r\\nstirring, and the rain might not reach this section.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dull red glow was reflected on the clouds over the river-bottom. When\\r\\nHiram looked from his window, just as he was ready for bed, that glow\\r\\nseemed to have increased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strange,\" he muttered. \"It can\\'t be that those fires have spread. There\\r\\nwas no chance for them to spread. I--don\\'t--understand it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat at the window and stared out through the darkness. There was\\r\\nlittle wind as yet; it was a fact, however, that the firelight flickered\\r\\non the low-hung clouds with increasing radiance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I mad?\" demanded the young farmer, suddenly leaping up and drawing\\r\\non his garments again. \"That fire is spreading.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dressed fully, and ran softly down the stairs and left the house.\\r\\nWhen he came out in the clear the glow had not receded. There was a fire\\r\\ndown the hillside, and it seemed increasing every moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe remembered the enemy in the dark, and without stopping to rouse the\\r\\nhousehold, ran on toward the woods, his heart beating heavily in his\\r\\nbosom.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlipping, falling at times, panting heavily because of the rough ground,\\r\\nHiram came at last through the more open timber to the brink of that\\r\\nsteep descent, at the bottom of which lay the smoky river-bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd indeed, the whole of the lowland seemed filled with stifling clouds\\r\\nof smoke. Yet, from a dozen places along the foot of the hill, yellow\\r\\nflames were starting up, kindling higher, and devouring as fast as might\\r\\nbe the leaves and tinder left from the wrack of winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nearest bonfire had been a hundred yards from the foot of this hill.\\r\\nHis care, Hiram knew, had left no chance of the dull coals in any of the\\r\\ntwenty heaps spreading to the verge of the grove.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan\\'s hand had done this. An enemy, waiting and watching until they had\\r\\nleft the field, had stolen down, gathered burning brands, and spread\\r\\nthem along the bottom of the hill, where the increasing wind might\\r\\nscatter the fire until the whole grove was in a blaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only was Mrs. Atterson\\'s timber in danger, but Darrell\\'s tract\\r\\nand that lying beyond would be overwhelmed by the flames if they were\\r\\nallowed to spread.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side, Dickerson had cut his timber a year or two before,\\r\\nclear to the river. The fire would not burn far over his line. Whoever\\r\\nhad done this dastardly act, Dickerson\\'s property would not be damaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram lent no time to trouble. His work was cut out for him right\\r\\nhere and now--and well he knew it!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had brought the small axe with him, having caught it up from the\\r\\ndoorstep. Now he used it to cut a green bough, and then ran with the\\r\\nlatter down the hill and set upon the fire-line like a madman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smoke, spread here and there by puffs of rising wind, half choked\\r\\nhim. It stung his eyes until they distilled water enough to blind him.\\r\\nHe thrashed and fought in the fumes and the murk of it, stumbling and\\r\\nslipping, one moment half-knee deep in quick-springing flames, the next\\r\\nalmost overpowered by the smudge that rose from the beaten mat of leaves\\r\\nand rubbish.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a lone fight. He had to do it all. There had been no time to\\r\\nrouse either the neighbors, or the rest of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he did not overcome these flames--and well he knew it--Mother\\r\\nAtterson would arise in the morning to see all her goodly timber\\r\\nscorched, perhaps ruined!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must beat it out--beat it out!\" thought Hiram, and the repetition\\r\\nof the words thrummed an accompaniment upon the drums of his ears as he\\r\\nthrashed away with a madman\\'s strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor no sane person would have tackled such a hopeless task. Before\\r\\nhim the flames suddenly leaped six feet or more into the air. They\\r\\novertopped him as they writhed through a clump of green-briars. The wind\\r\\npuffed the flame toward him, and his face was scorched by the heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lost his eyebrows completely, and the hair was crisped along the\\r\\nfront brim of his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen with a laughing crackle, as though scorning his weakness, the\\r\\nflames ran up a climbing vine and the next moment wrapped a tall pine in\\r\\nlurid yellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis pine, like a huge torch, began to give off a thick, black smoke.\\r\\nWould some wakeful neighboring farmer, seeing it, know the danger that\\r\\nmenaced and come to Hiram\\'s help?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor yards he had beaten flat the flames and stamped out every spark.\\r\\nBehind him was naught but rolling smoke. It was dark there. No flames\\r\\nwere eating up the slope.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut toward Darrell\\'s tract the fire seemed on the increase. He could not\\r\\ncatch up with it. And this solitary, sentinel pine, ablaze now in all\\r\\nits head, threatened to fling sparks for a hundred yards.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the wind continued to rise, the forest was doomed!\\r\\n\\r\\nHis green branch had burned to a crisp. He had lost his axe in the\\r\\ndarkness and the smoke, and now he tore another bough, by main strength,\\r\\nfrom its parent stem.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram Strong worked as though inspired; but to no purpose in the end.\\r\\nFor the flames increased. Puff after puff of wind drove the fire on,\\r\\nscattering brands from the blazing pine; and now another, and another,\\r\\ntree caught. The glare of the conflagration increased.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flung down the useless bough. Fire was all about him. He had to leap\\r\\nsuddenly to one side to escape a burst of flame that had caught in a\\r\\njungle of green-briars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, of a sudden, a crash of thunder rolled and reverberated through\\r\\nthe glen. Lightning for an instant lit up the meadows and the river.\\r\\nThe glare of it almost blinded the young farmer and, out of the line of\\r\\nfire, he sank to the earth and covered his eyes, seared by the sudden,\\r\\ncompelling light.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain and again the thunder rolled, following the javelins of lightning\\r\\nthat seemed to dart from the clouds to the earth. The tempest, so long\\r\\nmuttering in the West, had come upon him unexpectedly, for he had given\\r\\nall his attention to the spreading fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now came the rain--no refreshing, sweet, saturating shower; but a\\r\\nthunderous, blinding fall of water that first set the burning woods to\\r\\nsteaming and then drowned out every spark of fire on upland as well as\\r\\nlowland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a cloudburst--a downpour such as Hiram had seldom experienced\\r\\nbefore. Exhausted, he lay on the bank and let the pelting rain soak him\\r\\nto the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not care. Half drowned by the beating rain, he only crowed his\\r\\ndelight at the downpour. Every spark of fire was flooded out. The danger\\r\\nwas past.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe finally arose, and staggered through the downpour to the house, only\\r\\nhappy that--by a merciful interposition of Providence--the peril had\\r\\nbeen overcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tore off his clothing on the stoop, there in the pitch darkness, and\\r\\ncrept up to his bedroom where he rubbed himself down with a crash-towel,\\r\\nand finally tumbled into bed and slept like a log till broad daylight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII. FIRST FRUITS\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time since they had come to the farm, Hiram was the\\r\\nlast to get up in the house. And when he came down to breakfast,\\r\\nstill trembling from the exertion of the previous night, Mrs. Atterson\\r\\nscreamed at the sight of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the good Land o\\' Goshen!\" she cried. \"You look like a singed\\r\\nchicken, Hiram Strong! Whatever have you been doing to yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told them of the fight he had had while they slept. But he could talk\\r\\nabout it jokingly now, although Sister was inclined to snivel a little\\r\\nover his danger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That Dickerson boy ought to be lashed--Nine and thirty lashes--none too\\r\\nmuch--This sausage is good--humph!--and pancakes--fit for the gods--But\\r\\nhe\\'ll come back--do more damage--the butter, yes I I want butter--and\\r\\nsyrup, though two spreads is reckless extravagance--Eh? eh? can\\'t prove\\r\\nanything against that Dickerson lout?-well, mebbe not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Old Lem Camp commented upon the affair. But Hiram could not prove\\r\\nthat the neighbor\\'s boy had done any of these things which pointed to a\\r\\nmalicious enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young farmer began to wonder if he could not lay a trap, and so\\r\\nbring about his undoing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the ground was in fit condition again (for the nights rain\\r\\nhad been heavy) Hiram scattered the lime he had planned to use upon\\r\\nthe four acres of land plowed for corn, and dragged it in with a\\r\\nspike-toothed harrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking as he was with one horse alone, this took considerable time,\\r\\nand when this corn land was ready, it was time for him to go through the\\r\\ngarden piece again with the horse cultivator.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister and Lem Camp, both, had learned to use the man-weight wheel-hoe,\\r\\nand the fine stuff was thinned and the weeds well cut out. From time\\r\\nto time the young farmer had planted peas--both the dwarf and taller\\r\\nvarieties--and now he risked putting in some early beans--\"snap\" and\\r\\nbush limas--and his first planting of sweet corn.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the latter he put in four rows across the garden, each, of sixty-five\\r\\nday, seventy-five day, and ninety day sugar corn--all of well-known\\r\\nkinds. He planned later to put in, every fortnight, four rows of a\\r\\nmid-length season corn, so as to have green corn for sale, and for the\\r\\nhouse, up to frost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potatoes were growing finely and he hilled them up for the first\\r\\ntime. He marked his four-acre lot for field corn--cross-checking it\\r\\nthree-feet, ten inches apart. This made twenty-seven hundred and fifty\\r\\nhills to the acre, and with the hand-planter--an ingenious but cheap\\r\\nmachine--he dropped two and three kernels to the hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis upland, save where he had spread coarse stable manure, was\\r\\nnot rich. Upon each corn-hill he had Sister throw half a handful of\\r\\nfertilizer. She followed him as he used the planter, and they planted\\r\\nand fertilized the entire four acres in less than two days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lime he had put into the land would release such fertility as\\r\\nremained dormant there; but Hiram did not expect a big crop of corn on\\r\\nthat piece. If he made two good ears to the hill he would be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had knocked together a rough cold-frame, on the sunny side of the\\r\\nwoodshed, to fit some old sash he had found in the barn. Into the rich\\r\\nearth sifted to make the bed in this frame, he transplanted tomato,\\r\\negg-plant, pepper and other plants of a delicate nature. Early cabbage\\r\\nand cauliflower had already gone into the garden plot, and in the midst\\r\\nof an early and saturating rain, all day long, he had transplanted\\r\\ntable-beets into the rows he had marked out for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis variety of vegetables were now all growing finely. He sold nearly\\r\\nsix dollars\\' worth of radishes in town, and these radishes he showed\\r\\nMrs. Atterson were really \"clear profit.\" They had all been pulled from\\r\\nthe rows of carrots and other small seeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several heavy rains after the tempest which had been so\\r\\nProvidential; the ground was well saturated, and the river had risen\\r\\nuntil it roared between its banks in a voice that could be heard, on a\\r\\nstill day, at the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rains started the vegetation growing by leaps and bounds; weeds\\r\\nalways increase faster than any other growing thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was plenty for Hiram to do in the garden, and he kept Sister and\\r\\nOld Lem Camp busy, too. They were at it from the first faint streak of\\r\\nlight in the morning until dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were well--and happy. Mother Atterson, her heart troubled by\\r\\nthought of \"that Pepper-man,\" could not always repress her smiles. If\\r\\nthe danger of losing the farm were past, she would have had nothing in\\r\\nthe world to trouble her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hundred eggs she had purchased for five dollars had proven more than\\r\\nsixty per cent fertile. Some advice that Hiram had given her enabled\\r\\nMrs. Atterson to handle the chickens so that the loss from disease was\\r\\nvery small.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knocked together for her a couple of pens, eight feet square, which\\r\\ncould be moved about on the grass every day. In these pens the seventy,\\r\\nor more, chicks thrived immensely. And Sister was devoted to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the old white-faced cow, that had been a terror to Mother\\r\\nAtterson at the start, had found her calf, and it was a heifer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take my advice and raise it,\" said Hiram. \"She is a scrub, but she is a\\r\\npretty good scrub. You\\'ll see that she will give a good measure of milk.\\r\\nAnd what this farm needs is cattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you could make stable manure enough to cover the cleared acres a\\r\\nfoot deep, you could raise almost any crop you might name--and\\r\\nmake money by it. The land is impoverished by the use of commercial\\r\\nfertilizers, unbalanced by humus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I guess You know, Hiram,\" admitted Mrs. Atterson. \"And that\\r\\ncalf certainly is a pretty creeter. It would be too bad to turn it into\\r\\nveal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram did not intend to raise the calf expensively, however. He took it\\r\\naway from its mother right at the start, and in two weeks it was eating\\r\\ngrass, and guzzling skimmed milk and calf-meal, while the old cow was\\r\\nbeginning to show her employer her value.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson bought a small churn and quickly learned that \"slight\" at\\r\\nbutter-making which is absolutely essential if one would succeed in the\\r\\ndairy business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cow turned out to pasture early in May, too; so her keep was not\\r\\nso heavy a burden. She lowed some after the calf; but the latter was\\r\\ngrowing finely under Hiram\\'s care, and Mrs. Atterson had at least two\\r\\npounds of butter for sale each week, and the housekeeper at the St.\\r\\nBeris school paid her thirty-five cents a pound for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram gradually picked up a retail route in the town, which customers\\r\\npaid more for the surplus vegetables--and butter--than could be obtained\\r\\nat the stores. He had taught Sister how to drive, and sometimes even\\r\\nMrs. Atterson went in with the vegetables.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis relieved the young farmer and allowed him to work in the fields.\\r\\nAnd during these warm, growing May days, he found plenty to do. Just as\\r\\nthe field corn pushed through the ground he went into the lot with his\\r\\n14-tooth harrow and broke up the crust and so killed the ever-springing\\r\\nweeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the spikes on the harrow \"set back,\" no corn-plants were dragged\\r\\nout of the ground. This first harrowing, too, mixed the fertilizer with\\r\\nthe soil, and gave the corn the start it so sadly needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusy as bees, the four transplanted people at the Atterson farmhouse\\r\\naccomplished a great deal during these first weeks of the warming\\r\\nseason. And all four of them--Mrs. Atterson, Sister, Old Lem, and Hiram\\r\\nhimself--enjoyed the work to the full.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII. TOMATOES AND TROUBLE\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram Strong had decided that the market prospects of Scoville\\r\\nprophesied a good price for early tomatoes. He advised, therefore, a\\r\\ngood sized patch of this vegetable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had planted in the window boxes seed of several different varieties.\\r\\nHe had transplanted to the coldframe strong plants numbering nearly five\\r\\nhundred. He believed that, under garden cultivation, a tomato plant that\\r\\nwould not yield fifty cents worth of fruit was not worth bothering\\r\\nwith, while a dollar from a single plant was not beyond the bounds of\\r\\nprobability.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was safe, Hiram very well knew, to set out tomato plants in this\\r\\nlocality much before the middle of May; yet he was willing to take some\\r\\nrisks, and go to some trouble, for the sake of getting early ripened\\r\\ntomatoes into the Scoville market.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Henry Pollock had prophesied, Hiram did not see much of his friend\\r\\nduring corn-planting time. The Pollocks put nearly fifty acres in corn,\\r\\nand the whole family helped in the work, including Mrs. Pollock herself,\\r\\nand down to the child next to the baby. This little toddler amused his\\r\\nyounger brother, and brought water to the field for the workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther families in the neighborhood did the same, Hiram noticed. They all\\r\\nstrained every effort to put in corn, cultivating as big a crop as they\\r\\npossibly could handle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was why locally grown vegetables were scarce in Scoville. And the\\r\\nyoung farmer proposed to take advantage of this condition of affairs to\\r\\nthe best of his ability.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they were only to remain here on the farm long enough to handle this\\r\\none crop, Hiram determined to make that crop pay his employer as well as\\r\\npossible, although he, himself, had no share in such profit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Pollock, however, came along while Hiram was making ready his plat\\r\\nin the garden for tomatoes. The young farmer was setting several rows of\\r\\ntwo-inch thick stakes across the garden, sixteen feet apart in the row,\\r\\nthe rows four feet apart. The stakes themselves were about four feet out\\r\\nof the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What ye doin\\' there, Hiram?\" asked Henry, curiously. \"Building a\\r\\nfence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ain\\'t goin\\' to have a chicken run out here in the garden, be ye?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should hope not! The chickens on this place will never mix with the\\r\\ngarden trucks, if I have any say about it,\" declared Hiram, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jo!\" exclaimed Henry. \"Dad says Maw\\'s dratted hens eat up a couple\\r\\nhundred dollars\\' worth of corn and clover every year for him-runnin\\'\\r\\nloose as they do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why doesn\\'t he build your mother proper runs, then, plant green stuff\\r\\nin several yards, and change the flock over, from yard to yard?\" \"Oh,\\r\\nhens won\\'t do well shut up; Maw says so,\" said Henry, repeating the\\r\\nlazy farmer\\'s unfounded declaration-probably originated ages ago, when\\r\\npoultry was first domesticated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll show you, next year, if we are around here,\" said Hiram, \"whether\\r\\npoultry will do well enclosed in yards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told mother you didn\\'t let your chickens run free, and had no hens\\r\\nwith them,\" said Henry, thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. I do not believe in letting anything on a farm get into lazy\\r\\nhabits. A hen is primarily intended to lay eggs. I send them back to\\r\\nwork when they have hatched out their brood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Those home-made brooders of ours keep the chicks quite as warm, and\\r\\nnever peck the little fellows, or step upon them, as the old hen often\\r\\ndoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, I allow,\" admitted Henry, grinning broadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And some hens will traipse chicks through the grass and weeds as far\\r\\nas turkeys. No, sir! Send the hens back to business, and let the chicks\\r\\nshift for themselves. They\\'ll do better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Them there in the pens certainly do look healthy,\" said his friend.\\r\\n\"But you ain\\'t said what you was doin\\' here, Hiram, setting these\\r\\nstakes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I\\'ll tell you,\" returned Hiram. \"This is my tomato patch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jo!\" ejaculated Henry. \"You don\\'t want to set tomatoes so fur apart,\\r\\ndo you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" laughed Hiram. \"The posts are to string wires on. The tomatoes\\r\\nwill be two feet apart in the row. As they grow I tie them to the wires,\\r\\nand so keep the fruit off the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The tomato ripens better and more evenly, and the fruit will come\\r\\nearlier, especially if I pinch back the ends of the vine from time to\\r\\ntime, and remove some of the side branches.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We don\\'t do all that to raise a tomato crop. And we\\'ll put in five\\r\\nacres for the cannery this year, as usual,\" said Henry, with some scorn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We run the rows out four feet apart, like you do, throwing up a list,\\r\\nin fact. Then father goes ahead with a stick, making a hole for the\\r\\nplant every three feet, so\\'t they\\'ll be check-rowed and we can cultivate\\r\\nthem both ways--and we all set the plants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never hand-hoe \\'em--it don\\'t pay. The cannery isn\\'t giving but\\r\\nfifteen cents a basket this year--and it\\'s got to be a full five-eighths\\r\\nbasket, too, for they weigh \\'em.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram looked at him with a quizzical smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you set about thirty-six hundred and forty plants to the acre?\" he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I reckon so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you\\'ll have five acres of tomatoes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yep. So Dad says. He has contracted for that many. But our plants\\r\\ndon\\'t begin to be big enough to set out yet. We have to keep \\'em covered\\r\\nnights.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I expect to have about five hundred plants in this patch,\" said\\r\\nHiram, smiling. \"I tell you what, Henry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Huh?\" said the other boy. \"I bet I take in from my patch--net income, I\\r\\nmean--this year as much as your father gets at the cannery for his whole\\r\\ncrop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense!\" cried Henry. \"Maybe Dad\\'ll make a hundred, or a hundred and\\r\\ntwenty-five dollars. Sometimes tomatoes run as high as thirty dollars an\\r\\nacre around here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait and see,\" said Hiram, laughing. \"It is going to cost me more to\\r\\nraise my crop, and market it, that\\'s true. But if your father doesn\\'t do\\r\\nbetter with his five acres than you say, I\\'ll beat him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t do it, Hiram,\" cried Henry. \"I can try, anyway,\" said Hiram,\\r\\nmore quietly, but with confidence. \"We\\'ll see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And say,\" Henry added, suddenly, \"I was going to tell you something.\\r\\nYou won\\'t raise these tomatoes--nor no other crop--if Pete Dickerson can\\r\\nstop ye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with Pete now?\" asked Hiram, troubled by thought of\\r\\nthe secret enemy who had already struck at him in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was blowing about what he\\'d do to you down at the crossroads last\\r\\nevening,\" said Henry. \"He and his father both hate you like poison, I\\r\\nexpect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the fellers down to Cale Schell\\'s are always stirrin\\' up trouble.\\r\\nThey think it is sport. Why, Pete got so mad last night he could ha\\'\\r\\nchewed tacks!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have said nothing about Pete to anybody,\" said Hiram, firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That don\\'t matter. They say you have. They tell Pete a whole lot of\\r\\nstuff just to see him git riled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And last night he slopped over. He said if you reported around that he\\r\\nput fire to Mis\\' Atterson\\'s woods, he\\'d put it to the house and barns!\\r\\nOh, he was wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram\\'s face flushed, and then paled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Pete try to bum the woods, Hiram?\" queried Henry, shrewdly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never even said I thought so to you, have I?\" asked the young farmer,\\r\\nsternly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nope. I only heard that fire got into the woods by accident, when I\\r\\nwas in town. Somebody was hunting through there for coon, and saw the\\r\\nburned-over place. That\\'s all the fellers at Cale\\'s place knew, too, I\\r\\nreckon; but they jest put it up to Pete to mad him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they succeeded, did they?\" said Hiram, sternly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I reckon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Loose-mouthed people make more trouble in a community than downright\\r\\nmean ones,\" declared Hiram. \"If I have any serious trouble with the\\r\\nDickersons, like enough it will be because of the interference of the\\r\\nother neighbors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Henry, preparing to go on, \"Pete wouldn\\'t dare fire your\\r\\nstable now--after sayin\\' he\\'d do it. He ain\\'t quite so big a fool as all\\r\\nthat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram was not so sure. He had this additional trouble on his mind\\r\\nfrom this very hour, though he never said a word to Mrs. Atterson about\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut every night before he went to bed be made around of the outbuildings\\r\\nto make sure that everything was right before he slept.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV. \"CORN THAT\\'S CORN\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram caught sight of Pepper in town one day and went after him. He knew\\r\\nthe real estate man had returned from his business trip, and the fact\\r\\nthat the matter of the option was hanging fire, and troubling Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson exceedingly, urged Hiram go counter to Mr. Strickland\\'s advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyer had said: \"Let sleeping dogs lie.\" Pepper had made no move,\\r\\nhowever, and the uncertainty was very trying both for the young farmer\\r\\nand his employer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How about that option you talked about, Mr. Pepper?\" asked the \"youth.\\r\\nAre you going to exercise it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got time enough, ain\\'t I?\" returned the real estate man, eyeing\\r\\nHiram in his very slyest way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I expect you have--if it really runs a year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You seen it, didn\\'t you?\" demanded Pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we\\'d like Mr. Strickland to see it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s goin\\' to act for Mrs. Atterson?\" queried the man, with a scowl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, he\\'ll see it-when I\\'m ready to take it up. Don\\'t you fret,\"\\r\\nretorted Pepper, and turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis did not encourage the young farmer, nor was there anything in the\\r\\nman\\'s manner to yield hope to Mrs. Atterson that she could feel secure\\r\\nin her title to the farm. So Hiram said nothing to her about meeting the\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the youth was very much puzzled. It really did seem as though Pepper\\r\\nwas afraid to show that paper to Mr. Strickland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s something queer about it, I believe,\" declared the youth to\\r\\nhimself. \"Somewhere there is a trick. He\\'s afraid of being tripped up on\\r\\nit. But, why does he wait, if he knows the railroad is going to demand a\\r\\nstrip of the farm and he can get a good price for it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he is waiting to make sure that the railroad will condemn a\\r\\npiece of Mrs. Atterson\\'s farm. If the board should change the route\\r\\nagain, Pepper would have a farm on his hands that he might not be able\\r\\nto sell immediately at a profit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For we must confess, that sixteen hundred dollars, as farms have sold\\r\\nin the past around here, is a good price for the Atterson place. That\\'s\\r\\nwhy Uncle Jeptha was willing to give an option for a month--if that was,\\r\\nin the beginning, the understanding the old man had of his agreement\\r\\nwith Pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However, we might as well go ahead with the work, and take what comes\\r\\nto us in the end. I know no other way to do,\" quoth Hiram, with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor he could not be very cheerful with the prospect of making only a\\r\\nsingle crop on the place. His profit was to have come out of the second\\r\\nyear\\'s crop--and, he felt, out of that bottom land which had so charmed\\r\\nhim on the day he and Henry Pollock had gone over the Atterson Place.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiches lay buried in that six acres of bottom. Hiram had read up on\\r\\nonion culture, and he believed that, if he planted his seed in hot beds,\\r\\nand transplanted the young onions to the rich soil in this bottom, he\\r\\ncould raise fully as large onions as they did in either Texas or the\\r\\nBermudas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, they have the advantage of a longer season down there,\"\\r\\nthought Hiram, \"and cheap labor. But maybe I can get cheap labor right\\r\\naround here. The children of these farmers are used to working in the\\r\\nfields. I ought to be able to get help pretty cheap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when it comes to the market--why, I\\'ve got the Texas growers, at\\r\\nleast, skinned a little! I can reach either the Philadelphia or New York\\r\\nmarket in a day. Yes; given the right conditions, onions ought to pay\\r\\nbig down there on that lowland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was not the only crop possibility be turned over in his mind.\\r\\nThere were other vegetables that would grow luxuriantly on that bottom\\r\\nland--providing, always, the flood did not come and fulfill Henry\\r\\nPollock\\'s prophecy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two feet of water on that meadow, eh?\" thought Hiram. \"Well, that\\r\\ncertainly would be bad. I wouldn\\'t want that to happen after the ground\\r\\nwas plowed this year, even. It would tear up the land, and sour it, and\\r\\nspoil it for a corn-crop, indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he was down a good deal to the river\\'s edge, watching the ebb and\\r\\nflow of the stream. A heavy rain would, over night, fill the river to\\r\\nits very brim and the open field, even beyond the marshy spot, would be\\r\\na-slop with standing water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It sure wouldn\\'t grow alfalfa,\" chuckled Hiram to himself one day. \"For\\r\\nthe water rises here a good deal closer to the surface than four feet,\\r\\nand alfalfa farmers declare that if the springs rise that high, there is\\r\\nno use in putting in alfalfa. Why! I reckon just now the water is within\\r\\nfour inches of the top of the ground.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the river remained so high, and the low ground so saturated with\\r\\nwater, he knew, too, that he could not get the six acres plowed in time\\r\\nto put in corn this year. And it was this year\\'s crop he must think\\r\\nabout first.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if Pepper did not exercise his option, and turn Mrs. Atterson\\r\\nout of the place, a big commercial crop of onions, or any other\\r\\nbetter-paying crop, could only be tried the second year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had got his seed corn for the upland piece of the man who raised\\r\\nthe best corn in the community. He had tried the fertility of each ear,\\r\\ndiscarded those which proved weakly, or infertile, and his stand of corn\\r\\nfor the four acres, which was now half hand high, was the best of any\\r\\nfarmer between the Atterson place and town.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this corn was a hundred-and-ten-day variety. The farmer he got it of\\r\\ntold him that he had raised a crop from a piece planted the day before\\r\\nthe Fourth of July; but it was safer to get it in at least by June\\r\\nfifteenth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here it was past June first, and the meadow land had not yet been\\r\\nplowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However,\" Hiram said to Henry, when they walked down to the riverside\\r\\non Sunday afternoon, \"I\\'m going ahead on Faith--just as the minister\\r\\nsaid in church this morning. If Faith can move mountains, we\\'ll give it\\r\\na chance to move something right down here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dunno, Hiram,\" returned the other boy, shaking his head. \"Father says\\r\\nhe\\'ll git in here for you with three head and a Number 3 plow by the\\r\\nmiddle of this week if you say so--\\'nless it rains again, of course. But\\r\\nhe\\'s afeared you\\'re goin\\' to waste Mrs. Atterson\\'s money for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing ventured, nothing gained,\" quoted Hiram, grimly. \"If a farmer\\r\\ndidn\\'t take chances every year, the whole world would starve to death!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" returned Henry, smiling too, \"let the other fellow take the\\r\\nchances--that\\'s dad\\'s motter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. And the \\'chancey\\' fellow skims the cream of things every time.\\r\\nNo, sir!\" declared the young fellow, \"I\\'m going to be among the\\r\\ncream-skimmers, or I won\\'t be a farmer at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the plow was put into the bottom-land Wednesday--and put in deep. By\\r\\nFriday night the whole piece was plowed and partly harrowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had drawn lime for this bottom-land, proposing to use beside only\\r\\na small amount of fertilizer. He spread this lime from his one-horse\\r\\nwagon, while Henry drag-harrowed behind him, and by Saturday noon the\\r\\njob was done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horses had not mired at all, much to Mr. Pollock\\'s surprise. And the\\r\\nplow had bit deep. All the heavy sod of the piece was covered well, and\\r\\nthe seed bed was fairly level--for corn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Pollocks did not work on Saturday afternoon, Hiram did\\r\\nnot feel as though he could stop at this time. Most of the farmers had\\r\\nalready planted their last piece of corn. Monday would be the fifteenth\\r\\nof the month.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the young farmer got his home-made corn-row marker down to the\\r\\nriver-bottom and began marking the piece that afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis marker ran out three rows at each trip across the field, and with\\r\\na white stake at either end, the youth managed to run his rows very\\r\\nstraight. He had a good eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this case he did not check-row his field. The land was\\r\\nrich--phenomenally rich, he believed. If he was going to have a crop of\\r\\ncorn here, he wanted a crop worth while.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the uplands the farmers were satisfied with from thirty to fifty\\r\\nbaskets of ear-corn to the acre. If this lowland was what he believed it\\r\\nwas, Hiram was sure it would make twice that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at that his corn crop here would only average twenty-five dollars to\\r\\nthe acre--not a phenomenal profit for Mrs. Atterson in that.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the land would be getting into shape for a better crop, and although\\r\\ncorn is a crop that will soon impoverish ground, if planted year after\\r\\nyear on the same piece, Hiram knew that the humus in this soil on the\\r\\nlowland was almost inexhaustible.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he marked his rows the long way of the field--running with the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the implements left by Uncle Jeptha had been a one-horse\\r\\ncorn-planter with a fertilizer attachment. Hiram used this, dropping\\r\\ntwo or three grains twenty-four inches apart, and setting the fertilizer\\r\\nattachment to one hundred and fifty pounds to the acre.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was until the next Wednesday night planting the piece. Meanwhile it\\r\\nhad not rained, and the river continued to recede. It was now almost\\r\\nas low as it had been the day Lettie Bronson\\'s boating party had been\\r\\n\"wrecked\" under the big sycamore.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had not seen the Bronsons for some weeks, but about the time he\\r\\ngot his late corn planted, Mr. Bronson drove into the Atterson yard, and\\r\\nfound Hiram cultivating his first corn with the five-tooth cultivator.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, Hiram!\" exclaimed the Westerner, looking with a broad smile\\r\\nover the field. \"That\\'s as pretty a field of corn as I ever saw. I don\\'t\\r\\nbelieve there is a hill missing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only a few on the far edge, where the moles have been at work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Moles don\\'t eat corn, Hiram.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So they say,\" returned the young farmer, quietly. \"I never could make\\r\\nup my mind about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure, however, that if they are only after slugs and worms which\\r\\nare drawn to the corn hills by the commercial fertilizer, the moles do\\r\\nfully as much damage as the slugs would.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, they make a cavity under the corn hill, and the roots of the\\r\\nplant wither. Excuse me, but I\\'d rather have Mr. Mole in somebody else\\'s\\r\\ngarden.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bronson laughed. \"Well, what the little gray fellows eat won\\'t kill\\r\\nus. But they do spoil otherwise handsome rows. How did you get such a\\r\\ngood stand of corn, Hiram?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tested the seed in a seed box early in the spring. I wouldn\\'t plant\\r\\ncorn any other way. Aside from the hills the moles have spoiled, and a\\r\\nfew an old crow pulled up, I\\'ve got no re-planting to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And replanted hills are always behind the crop, and seldom make\\r\\nanything but fodder. If it wasn\\'t for the look of the field, I\\'d never\\r\\nre-plant a hill of corn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, I\\'ve got to thin this--two grains in the hill is enough on\\r\\nthis land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bronson looked at him with growing surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, my boy, you talk just as though you had tilled the ground for a\\r\\nscore of years. Who taught you so much about farming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of the best farmers who ever lived,\" said Hiram, with a smile. \"My\\r\\nfather. And he taught me to go to the correct sources for information,\\r\\ntoo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe you!\" exclaimed Mr. Bronson. \"And you\\'re going to have \\'corn\\r\\nthat\\'s corn\\', as we say in my part of the country, on this piece of\\r\\nland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait!\" said Hiram, smiling and shaking his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait for what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait till you see the corn on my bottom-land--if the river down there\\r\\ndoesn\\'t drown it out. If we don\\'t have too much rain, I\\'m going to have\\r\\ncorn on that river-bottom that will beat anything in this county, Mr.\\r\\nBronson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the young farmer spoke with assurance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV. THE BARBECUE\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the seventeenth day of June Hiram had \"grappled out\" a mess of\\r\\npotatoes for their dinner. They were larger than hen\\'s eggs and came\\r\\nupon the table mealy and white.\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes were selling at retail in Scoville for two dollars the bushel.\\r\\nBefore the end of that week--after the lowland corn was planted--Hiram\\r\\ndug two rows of potatoes, sorted them, and carted them to town, together\\r\\nwith some bunched beets, a few bunches of young carrots, radishes and\\r\\nsalad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potatoes he sold for fifty cents the five-eighth basket, from house\\r\\nto house, and he brought back, for his load of vegetables, ten dollars\\r\\nand twenty cents, which he handed to Mrs. Atterson, much to that lady\\'s\\r\\njoy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My soul and body, Hiram!\" she exclaimed. \"This is just a God-send--no\\r\\nless. Do you know that we\\'ve sold nigh twenty-five dollars\\' worth of\\r\\nstuff already this spring, besides that pair of pigs I let Pollock have,\\r\\nand the butter to St. Beris?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it\\'s only a beginning,\" Hiram told her. \"Wait til\\' the peas come\\r\\nalong--we\\'ll have a mess for the table in a few days now. And the sweet\\r\\ncorn and tomatoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you and Sister can do the selling, it will help out a whole lot, of\\r\\ncourse. I wish we had another horse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or an automobile,\" said Sister, clapping her hands. \"Wouldn\\'t it be\\r\\nfine to run into town in an auto, with a lot of vegetables? Then Hiram\\r\\ncould keep right at work with the horse and not have to stop to harness\\r\\nup for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shucks, child!\" admonished Mrs. Atterson. \"What big idees you do get in\\r\\nthat noddle o\\' yourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls\\' boarding school and the two hotels proved good customers for\\r\\nHiram\\'s early vegetables; for nobody around Scoville had potatoes\\r\\nat this time, and Hiram\\'s early peas were two weeks ahead of other\\r\\npeople\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving got a certain number of towns folks to expect him at least thrice\\r\\na week, when other farmers had green stuff for sale they could not\\r\\neasily \"cut out\" Hiram later in the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd not always did the young farmer have to leave his work at home to\\r\\ndeliver the vegetables and Mrs. Atterson\\'s butter. Sister, or the old\\r\\nlady herself, could go to town if the load was not too heavy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, it cost considerable to live. And hogfood and grain for the\\r\\nhorse and cow had to be bought. Hiram was fattening four of the spring\\r\\nshoats against winter. Two they could sell and two kill for their own\\r\\nuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Goin\\' to be big doin\\'s on the Fourth this year, Hiram,\" said Henry\\r\\nPollock, meeting the young farmer on the road from town one day. \"Heard\\r\\nabout it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Scoville, do you mean? They\\'re going to have a \\'Safe and Sane\\'\\r\\nFourth, the Banner says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nope. We don\\'t think much of goin\\' to town Fourth of July. And this\\r\\nyear there\\'s goin\\' to be a big picnic in Langdon\\'s Grove--that\\'s up the\\r\\nriver, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A public picnic?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure. A barbecue, we call it,\" said Henry. \"We have one at the Grove\\r\\nev\\'ry year. This time the two Sunday Schools is goin\\' to join and have a\\r\\nbig time. You and Sister don\\'t want to miss it. That Mr. Bronson\\'s goin\\'\\r\\nto give a whole side o\\' beef, they tell me, to roast over the fires.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A big banquet is in prospect, is it?\" asked Hiram, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a stew! Gee! you never eat one o\\' these barbecue stews, did ye?\\r\\nSome of us will go huntin\\' the day before, and there\\'ll be birds, and\\r\\nsquirrels, as well as chickens in that stew--and lima beans, and corn,\\r\\nand everything good you can think of!\" and Henry smacked his lips in\\r\\nprospect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he added, bethinking himself of his errand:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everybody chips in and gives the things to eat. What\\'ll you give,\\r\\nHiram?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some vegetables,\" said Hiram, quickly. \"Mrs. Atterson won\\'t object, I\\r\\nguess. Do they want tomatoes for their stew?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t be no tomatoes ripe, Hiram,\" said Henry, decidedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There won\\'t, eh? You come out and take a look at mine,\" said Hiram,\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the rows of vegetables in Hiram\\'s garden plot, the thriftiest\\r\\nand handsomest were the trellised tomato plants. It took nearly half of\\r\\nSister\\'s time to keep the plants tied up and pinched back, as Hiram had\\r\\ntaught her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the stalks were already heavily laden with fruit; and those hanging\\r\\nlowest on the sturdy vines were already blushing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jo!\" gasped Henry. \"You\\'ve done it, ain\\'t you? But the cannery won\\'t\\r\\ntake \\'em yet awhile--and they\\'ll all be gone before September.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The cannery won\\'t get many of my tomatoes,\" laughed Hiram. \"And these\\r\\nvines properly trained and cultivated as they are, will bear fruit up to\\r\\nfrost. You wait and see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll have to tell dad to come and look at these. I dunno, Hiram, if you\\r\\ncan sell \\'em at retail, but you\\'ll git as much for \\'em as dad does for\\r\\nhis whole crop--just as you said.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what I\\'m aiming for,\" responded Hiram. \"But would the ladies who\\r\\ncook the barbecue stew care for tomatoes, do you think?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never git tomatoes this early,\" said Henry. \"How about potatoes? And\\r\\nthere ain\\'t many folks dug any of theirn yet, but you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, after speaking with Mrs. Atterson, Hiram agreed to supply a barrel\\r\\nof potatoes for the barbecue, and the day before the Fourth, one of the\\r\\nfarmers came with a wagon to pick up the supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody at the Atterson farm would go to the grove--that was\\r\\nunderstood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If one knocks off work, the others can,\" declared Mother Atterson. \"You\\r\\nsee that things is left all right for the critters, Hiram, and we\\'ll\\r\\ntend to things indoors so that we can be gone till night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do, Hiram, look out for my poults the last thing,\" cried Sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Larriper had given Sister a setting of ten turkey eggs and every\\r\\none of them had hatched under one of Mrs. Atterson\\'s motherly old hens.\\r\\nAt first the girl had kept the young turkeys and their foster mother\\r\\nright near the house, so that she could watch them carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut poults are rangy, and these being particularly strong and thrifty,\\r\\nthey soon ran the old hen pretty nearly to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Hiram had built a coop into which they could go at night, safe from\\r\\nany vermin, and set it far down in the east lot, near the woods. Sister\\r\\nusually went down with a little grain twice a day to call them up, and\\r\\nkeep them tame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But when they get big enough to roost in the fall, I expect we\\'ll have\\r\\nto gather that crop with a gun,\" Hiram told her, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the farmers teams were strung out along the road long before\\r\\nHiram was ready to set out. He had made sure that the spring wagon was\\r\\nin good shape, and he had built an extra seat for it, so that the four\\r\\nrode very comfortably.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike every other Fourth of July, the sun was broiling hot! And the dust\\r\\nrose in clouds as the faster teams passed their slow old nag.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson sat up very primly in her best silk, holding a parasol and\\r\\nwearing a pair of lace mits that had appeared on state occasions for the\\r\\npast twenty years, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister was growing like a weed, and it was hard to keep her skirts and\\r\\nsleeves at a proper length. But she was an entirely different looking\\r\\ngirl from the boarding house slavey whom Hiram remembered so keenly back\\r\\nin Crawberry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Old Lem Camp, he was as cheerful as Hiram had ever seen him, and\\r\\nshowed a deal of interest in everything about the farm, and had proved\\r\\nhimself, as Mrs. Atterson had prophesied, a great help.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely a house along the road was not shut up and the dooryard\\r\\ndeserted--for everybody was going to the barbecue. All but the Dickerson\\r\\nfamily. Sam was at work in the fields, and the haggard Mrs. Dickerson\\r\\nlooked dumbly from her porch, with a crying baby in her scrawny arms as\\r\\nthe Attersons and Hiram passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Pete was at the barbecue. He was there when Hiram arrived, and he\\r\\nwas making himself quite as prominent as anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, he made himself so obnoxious finally, that one of the rough men\\r\\nwho was keeping up the fires threatened to chuck Pete into the biggest\\r\\none, and then cool him off in the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise, however, the barbecue passed off very pleasantly. The men who\\r\\ngoverned it saw that no liquor was brought along, and the unruly element\\r\\nto which Pete belonged was kept under with an iron hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was so little \"fun\", of a kind, in Pete\\'s estimation that, after\\r\\nthe big event of the day--the banquet--he and some of his friends\\r\\ndisappeared. And the picnicking ground was a much quieter and pleasanter\\r\\nplace after their departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newcomers into the community made many friends and acquaintances\\r\\nthat day. Sister was going to school in the fall, and she found many\\r\\ngirls of her age whom she would meet there.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson met the older ladies, and was invited to join no less than\\r\\ntwo \"Ladies\\' Aids\", and, as she said, \"if she called on all the\\r\\nfolks she\\'d agreed to visit, she\\'d be goin\\' ev\\'ry day from then till\\r\\nChristmas!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Hiram, the men and older boys were rather inclined to jolly him\\r\\na bit. Not many of them had been upon the Atterson place to see what\\r\\nhe had done, but they had heard some stories of his proposed crops that\\r\\namused them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Bronson, however, whom the local men knew to be a big farmer in\\r\\nthe Middle West, and who owned many farms out there now, spoke favorably\\r\\nof Hiram\\'s work, the local men listened respectfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The boy\\'s got it in him to do something,\" the Westerner said, in his\\r\\nhearty fashion. \"You\\'re eating his potatoes now, I understand. Which one\\r\\nof you can dig early potatoes like those?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he\\'s got the best stand of corn in the county.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On that river-bottom, you mean?\" asked one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And on the upland, too. You fellows want to look about you a little.\\r\\nMost of you don\\'t see beyond the end of your noses. You watch out,\\r\\nor Hiram Strong is going to beat every last one of you this year--and\\r\\nthat\\'s a run-down farm he\\'s got, at that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVI. SISTER\\'S TURKEYS\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Lettie was not at the barbecue, and to tell the truth, Hiram Strong\\r\\nwas disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the fact that she had seemed inclined to snub him, the young\\r\\nfarmer was vastly taken with the pretty girl. He had seen nobody about\\r\\nScoville as attractive as Lettie--nor anywhere else, for that matter!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was too proud to call at the Bronson place, although Mr. Bronson\\r\\ninvited him whenever he saw Hiram. And at first, Lettie had asked him to\\r\\ncome, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Western girl did not like being thwarted in any matter--even the\\r\\nsmallest. And when Hiram would not come to take Pete Dickerson\\'s place,\\r\\nthe very much indulged girl had showed the young farmer that she was\\r\\noffended.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the afternoon at Langdon\\'s Grove passed very pleasantly, and\\r\\nHiram and his party did not arrive at the farm again until dusk had\\r\\nfallen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll go down and shut your turkeys up for the night, Sister,\" Hiram\\r\\nsaid, after he had done the other chores for he knew the girl would be\\r\\nafraid to go so far from the house by lantern-light.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he reached the turkey coop, \\'way down in the field, Hiram was\\r\\nvery glad indeed that he had come instead of the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the coop was empty. There wasn\\'t a turkey inside, or thereabout. It\\r\\nhad been dark an hour and more, then, and the poults should long since\\r\\nhave been hovered in the coop.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad some marauding fox, or other \"varmint\", run the young turkeys off\\r\\ntheir reservation? That seemed improbable at this time of year--and so\\r\\nearly in the evening. Foxes do not usually go hunting before midnight,\\r\\nnor do other predatory animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had brought the barn lantern with him, and he took a look around\\r\\nthe neighborhood of the empty coop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My goodness!\" he mused, \"Sister will cry her eyes out if anything\\'s\\r\\nhappened to those little turks. Now, what\\'s this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ground was cut up at a little distance from the coop. He examined\\r\\nthe tracks closely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were fresh--very fresh indeed. The wheel tracks of a light wagon\\r\\nshowed, and the prints of a horse\\'s shod hoofs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wagon had been driven down from the main road, and had turned\\r\\nsharply here by the coop. Hiram knew, too, that it had stood there for\\r\\nsome time, for the horse had moved uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, that proved the driver had gotten out of the wagon and left\\r\\nthe horse alone. Doubtless there was but one thief--for it was\\r\\npositive that the turkeys had been removed by a two-footed--not a\\r\\nfour-footed--marauder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who would be mean enough to steal Sister\\'s turkeys? Almost\\r\\neverybody in the neighborhood has a few to fatten for Thanksgiving and\\r\\nChristmas. Who--did--this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe followed the wheel marks of the wagon to the road. He saw the track\\r\\nwhere it turned into the field, and where it turned out again. And\\r\\nit showed plainly that the thief came from town, and returned in that\\r\\ndirection.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, in the roadway it was impossible to trace the particular\\r\\ntracks made by the thief\\'s horse and wagon. Too many other vehicles had\\r\\nbeen over the road within the past hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thief must have driven into the field just after night-fall, plucked\\r\\nthe ten young turkeys, one by one, out of the coop, tying their feet\\r\\nand flinging them into the bottom of his wagon. Covered with a bag, the\\r\\nfrightened turkeys would never utter a peep while it remained dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hate to tell Sister--I can\\'t tell her,\" Hiram said, as he went slowly\\r\\nback to the house. For Sister had been \"counting chickens\" again, and\\r\\nshe had figured that, at eighteen cents per pound, live weight, the ten\\r\\nturkeys would pay for all the clothes she would need that winter, and\\r\\ngive her \"Christmas money\", too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young farmer shrank from meeting the girl again that night, and he\\r\\ndelayed going into the house as long as possible. Then he found they had\\r\\nall retired, leaving him a cold supper at the end of the kitchen table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disappearance of the turkeys kept Hiram tossing, wakeful, upon his\\r\\nbed for some hours. He could not fail to connect this robbery with the\\r\\nother things that had been done, during the past weeks, to injure those\\r\\nliving at the Atterson farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas the secret enemy really Peter Dickerson? And had Pete committed this\\r\\ncrime now?\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the horse and wagon had come from the direction opposite the\\r\\nDickerson farm, and had returned as it came.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know whether I am accusing that fellow wrongfully, or not,\"\\r\\nmuttered Hiram, at last. \"But I am going to find out. Sister isn\\'t going\\r\\nto lose her turkeys without my doing everything in my power to get them\\r\\nback and punish the thief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe usually arose in the morning before anybody else was astir, so it\\r\\nwas easy for Hiram to slip out of the house and down to the field to the\\r\\nempty turkey coop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marks of horse and wagon were quite as plain in the faint light of\\r\\ndawn as they had been the night before. In the darkness the thief\\r\\nhad driven his wagon over some small stumps, amid which his horse had\\r\\nscrambled in some difficulty, it was plain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram, tracing out these marks as a Red Indian follows a trail,\\r\\nsaw something upon the edge of one of the half-decayed stumps that\\r\\ninterested him greatly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood up the next moment with this clue in his hand--a white, coarse\\r\\nhair, perhaps four inches in length.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was scraped off the horse\\'s fetlock as he scrambled over this\\r\\nstump,\" muttered Hiram. \"Now, who drives a white horse, or a horse with\\r\\nwhite feet, in this neighborhood?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I narrow the search down in this way, I wonder?\" and for some\\r\\nmoments the youth stood there, in the growing light of early morning,\\r\\ncanvassing the subject from that angle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII. RUN TO EARTH\\r\\n\\r\\nA broad streak of crimson along the eastern horizon, over the treetops,\\r\\nannounced the coming of the sun when Hiram Strong reached the automobile\\r\\nroad to which he, on the previous night, had traced the thief that had\\r\\nstolen Sister\\'s poults.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow he looked at the track again. It surely had come from the direction\\r\\nof Scoville, and it turned back that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet he looked at the white horse-hair scraped off upon the stump, and\\r\\nhe turned his back upon these signs and strode along the road toward his\\r\\nown home.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoke was just curling from the Atterson chimney; Sister, or Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson, was just building the fire. But they did not see Hiram as he\\r\\nwent by.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram\\'s quest led him past the place and to the Dickerson farm. There\\r\\nnobody was yet astir, save the mules and horses in the barnyard, who\\r\\ncalled as he went by, hoping for their breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram knew that the Dickersons had turkeys and, like most of the other\\r\\nfarmers, cooped them in distant fields away from the house. He found\\r\\nthree coops in the middle of an old oat-field tinder a spreading beech.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old turks roosted upon the limbs of the beech at night; they were\\r\\nalready up and away, hunting grasshoppers for breakfast. But quite a few\\r\\npoults were running and peeping about the coops, with two hen turkeys\\r\\nplaying guard to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram saw where a wagon had been driven in here, and turned, too. The\\r\\ntracks were made recently. And one of the coops was shut tight, although\\r\\nhe knew by the rustling within that there were young turkeys in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was too dark within the hutch, however, for the youth to number the\\r\\npoults confined there.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe strolled back across the fields to the rear of the Dickerson house.\\r\\nPassing the barnyard first, he halted and examined the bright bay horse,\\r\\nwith white feet--the one that Pete had driven to the barbecue the day\\r\\nbefore--the only one Pete was ever allowed to drive off the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dickersons, father and son, were not as early risers as most farmers\\r\\nin those parts. At least, they were not up betimes on this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs. Dickerson had built the fire now and was stirring about the\\r\\nporch when Hiram arrived at the step, filling her kettle at the pump.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mornin\\', Mr. Strong,\" she said, in her startled way, eyeing Hiram\\r\\naskance.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a lean, sharp-featured woman, with a hopeless droop to her\\r\\nshoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-morning, Mrs. Dickerson,\" said Hiram, gravely. \"How many young\\r\\nturkeys have you this year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman shrank back and almost dropped the kettle she had filled to\\r\\nthe pump-bench. Her eyes glared.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere in the house a baby squatted; then a door banged and Hiram\\r\\nheard Dickerson\\'s heavy step descending the stair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a coop of poults down there, Mrs. Dickerson,\" continued Hiram,\\r\\nconfidently, \"that I know belongs to us. I traced Pete\\'s tracks with the\\r\\nwagon and the white-footed horse. Now, this is going to make trouble for\\r\\nPete----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with Pete, now?\" demanded Dickerson\\'s harsh voice,\\r\\nand he came out upon the porch.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scowled at sight of Hiram, and continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you roaming around here for, Strong? Can\\'t you keep on your\\r\\nown side of the fence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s little I\\'ll ever trouble you, Mr. Dickerson,\" said Hiram,\\r\\n\"sharply, if you and yours don\\'t trouble me, I can assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s eating you now?\" demanded the man, roughly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I\\'ll tell you, Mr. Dickerson,\" said Hiram, quickly. \"Somebody\\'s\\r\\nstolen our turkeys--ten of them. And I have found them down there where\\r\\nyour turkeys roost. The natural inference is that somebody here knows\\r\\nabout it----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDickerson--just out of his bed and as ugly as many people are when they\\r\\nfirst get up--leaped for the young farmer from the porch, and had him in\\r\\nhis grip before Hiram could help himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman screamed. There was a racket in the house, for some of the\\r\\nchildren had been watching from the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dad\\'s goin\\' to lick him!\" squalled one of the girls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You come here and intermate that any of my family\\'s thieves, do you?\"\\r\\nthe angry man roared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop that, Sam Dickerson!\" cried his wife. She suddenly gained courage\\r\\nand ran to the struggling pair, and tried to haul Sam away from Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The boy\\'s right,\" she gasped. \"I heard Pete tellin\\' little Sam last\\r\\nnight what he\\'d done. It\\'s come to a pretty pass, so it has, if you are\\r\\ngoin\\' to uphold that bad boy in thieving----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush up, Maw!\" cried Pete\\'s voice from the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come out here, you scalawag!\" ordered his father, relaxing his hold on\\r\\nHiram.\\r\\n\\r\\nPete slouched out on the porch, wearing a grin that was half sheepish,\\r\\nhalf worried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this Strong says about turkeys?\" demanded Sam Dickerson,\\r\\nsternly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tain\\'t so!\" declared Pete. \"I ain\\'t seen no turkeys.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have found them,\" said Hiram, quietly. \"And the coopful is down\\r\\nyonder in your lot. You thought to fool me by turning into our farm from\\r\\nthe direction of Scoville, and driving back that way; but you turned\\r\\naround in the road under that overhanging oak, where I picked Lettie\\r\\nBronson off the back of the runaway horse last Spring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, those ten turkeys belong to Sister. She\\'ll be heart-broken if\\r\\nanything happens to them. You have played me several mean tricks since I\\r\\nhave been here, Pete Dickerson----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I ain\\'t!\" interrupted the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who took the burr off the end of my axle and let me down in the road\\r\\nthat night?\" demanded Hiram, his rage rising.\\r\\n\\r\\nPete could not forbear a grin at this remembrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who tampered with our pump the next morning? And who watched and\\r\\nwaited till we left the lower meadow that night we burned the rubbish,\\r\\nand then set fire to our woods----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dickerson screamed again. \"I knew that fire never come by\\r\\naccident,\" she moaned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shut up, Maw!\" admonished her hopeful son again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now, I\\'ve got you,\" declared Hiram, with confidence. \"I can tell\\r\\nthose ten poults. I marked them for Sister long ago so that, if they\\r\\nwent to the neighbors, they could be easily identified.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'re in that shut-up coop down yonder,\" continued Hiram, \"and unless\\r\\nyou agree to bring them back at once, and put them in our coop, I shall\\r\\nhitch up and go to town, first thing, and get out a warrant for your\\r\\narrest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSam had remained silent for a minute, or two. Now he said, decidedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You needn\\'t threaten no more, young feller. I can see plain enough that\\r\\nPete\\'s been carrying his fun too far----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fun!\" ejaculated Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what I said,\" growled Sam. \"He\\'ll bring the turkeys back-and\\r\\nbefore he has his breakfast, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Hiram, knowing full well that there was nothing to\\r\\nbe made by quarreling with Sam Dickerson. \"His returning the turkeys,\\r\\nhowever, will not keep me from speaking to the constable the very next\\r\\ntime Pete plays any of his tricks around our place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may be \\'fun\\' for him; but it won\\'t look so funny from the inside of\\r\\nthe town jail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked off after this threat. And he was sorry he had said it. For he\\r\\nhad no real intention of having Pete arrested, and an empty threat is of\\r\\nno use to anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turkeys came back; Sister did not even know that they had been\\r\\nstolen, for when she went down to feed them about the middle of the\\r\\nforenoon, all ten came running to her call.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Pete Dickerson ceased from troubling for a time, much to Hiram\\'s\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the crops were coming on finely. Hiram\\'s tomatoes were\\r\\nbringing good prices in Scoville, and as he had such a quantity and was\\r\\nso much earlier than the other farmers around about, he did, as he told\\r\\nHenry he would do, \"skim the cream off the market.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bought some crates and baskets in town, too, and shipped some of\\r\\nthe tomatoes to a produce man he knew in Crawberry--a man whom he could\\r\\ntrust to treat him fairly. During the season that man\\'s checks to Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson amounted to fifty-four dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree times a week the spring wagon went to town with vegetables for the\\r\\nschool, the hotels, and their retail customers. The whole family worked\\r\\nlong hours, and worked hard; but nobody complained.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo rain fell of any consequence until the latter part of July; and then\\r\\nthere was no danger of the river overflowing and drowning out the corn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that corn! By the last of July it was waist high, growing rank and\\r\\nstrong, and of that black-green color which delights the farmer\\'s eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bronson walked down to the river especially to see it. Like Hiram\\'s\\r\\nupland corn, there was scarcely a hill missing, save where the muskrats\\r\\nhad dug in from the river bank and disturbed the corn hills.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the finest-looking corn in this county, bar none, Hiram,\"\\r\\ndeclared Bronson. \"I have seldom seen better looking in the rich\\r\\nbottom-lands of the West. And you certainly do keep it clean, boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No use in putting in a crop if you don\\'t \\'tend it,\" said the young\\r\\nfarmer, sententiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what\\'s this along here?\" asked the gentleman, pointing to a row or\\r\\ntwo of small stuff along the inner edge of the field.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m trying onions and celery down here. I want to put a commercial crop\\r\\ninto this field next year--if we are let stay here--that will pay Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson and me a real profit,\" and Hiram laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you call a real profit?\" inquired Mr. Bronson, seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four hundred dollars an acre, net,\" said the young farmer, promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Hiram, you can\\'t do that!\" cried the gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s being done--in other localities and on soil not so rich as\\r\\nthis--and I believe I can do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With onions or celery?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Which--or both?\" asked the\\r\\nWesterner, interested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am trying them out here, as you see. I believe it will be celery.\\r\\nThis soil is naturally wet, and celery is a glutton for water. Then, it\\r\\nis a late piece, and celery should be transplanted twice before it is\\r\\nput in the field, I believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lot of work, boy,\" said Mr. Bronson, shaking his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I never expect to get something for nothing,\" remarked Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how about the onions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, they don\\'t seem to do so well. There is something lacking in the\\r\\nland to make them do their best. I believe it is too cold. And, then, I\\r\\nam watching the onion market, and I am afraid that too many people\\r\\nhave gone into the game in certain sections, and are bound to create an\\r\\nover-supply.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman looked at him curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You certainly are an able-minded youngster, Hiram,\" he observed. \"I\\r\\ns\\'pose if you do so well here next year as you expect, a charge of\\r\\ndynamite wouldn\\'t blast you away from the Atterson farm?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Mr. Bronson,\" responded the young farmer, \"I don\\'t want to run a\\r\\none-horse farm all my life. And this never can be much more. It isn\\'t\\r\\nnear enough to any big city to be a real truck farm--and I\\'m interested\\r\\nin bigger things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir. The Atterson Eighty is only a stepping stone for me. I hope\\r\\nI\\'ll go higher before long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII. HARVEST\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram was not at all sure that he would ever see a celery crop in\\r\\nthis bottom-land. Pepper still \"hung fire\" and he would not go to Mr.\\r\\nStrickland with his option.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t hafter,\" he told Hiram. \"When I git ready I\\'ll let ye know, be\\r\\nsure o\\' that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact was that the railroad had made no further move. Mr. Strickland\\r\\nadmitted to Mrs. Atterson that if the strip along the east boundary\\r\\nof the farm was condemned by the railroad, she ought to get a thousand\\r\\ndollars for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if the railroad board should change its mind again,\" added the\\r\\nlawyer, \"sixteen hundred dollars would not be a speculative price to pay\\r\\nfor your farm--and well Pepper knows it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then Mr. Damocles\\'s sword has got to hang over us, has it?\" demanded\\r\\nthe old lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid so,\" admitted the lawyer, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson could not be more troubled than was Hiram himself. Youth\\r\\nfeels the sting of such arrows of fortune more keenly than does age. We\\r\\nget \"case-hardened\" to trouble as the years bend our shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought that he might, after all, get nothing but a hundred dollars\\r\\nand his board for all the work he had done in preparation for the second\\r\\nyear\\'s crop sometimes embittered Hiram\\'s thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce, when he spoke to Pepper, and the snaky man sneered at him and\\r\\nlaughed, the young farmer came near attacking him then and there in the\\r\\nstreet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly could have given that Pepper as good a thrashing as ever he\\r\\ngot,\" muttered Hiram. \"And even Pete Dickerson never deserved one more\\r\\nthan Pepper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPete fought shy of Hiram these days, and as the summer waned the young\\r\\nfarmer gradually became less watchful and expectant of trouble from the\\r\\ndirection of the west boundary of the Atterson Eighty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was little breathing spell for him in the work of the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When we lay by the corn, you bet dad an\\' me goes fishing!\" Henry\\r\\nPollock told Hiram, one day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it wasn\\'t often that the young farmer could take half a day off for\\r\\nany such pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve bit off more\\'n you kin chaw,\" observed Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all right; I\\'ll keep chewing at it, just the same,\" returned\\r\\nHiram cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the truck crop was bringing them in a bigger sum of money than even\\r\\nHiram had expected. The season had been very favorable, indeed; Hiram\\'s\\r\\nvegetables had come along in good time, and even the barrels of sweet\\r\\ncorn he shipped to Crawberry brought a fair price--much better than he\\r\\ncould have got at the local cannery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tomato pack came on, however, he did sell many baskets of his\\r\\n\"seconds\" to the cannery. But the selected tomatoes he continued to ship\\r\\nto Crawberry, and having established a reputation with his produce man\\r\\nfor handsome and evenly ripened fruit, the prices received were good all\\r\\nthrough the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw the sum for tomatoes pass the hundred and fifty dollar mark\\r\\nbefore frost struck the vines. Even then he was not satisfied. There was\\r\\na small cellar under the Atterson house, and when the frosty nights of\\r\\nOctober came, Hiram dragged up the vines still bearing fruit, by the\\r\\nroots, and hung them in the cellar, where the tomatoes continued to\\r\\nripen slowly nearly up to Thanksgiving.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther crops did almost as well in proportion. He had put in no late\\r\\npotatoes; but in September he harvested the balance of his early crop\\r\\nand, as they were a good keeping variety, he knew there would be enough\\r\\nto keep the family supplied until the next season.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf other roots, including a patch of well-grown mangels for Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson\\'s handsome flock of chickens, there were plenty to carry the\\r\\nfamily over the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the frosts became harder Hiram dug his root pits in the high, light\\r\\nsoil of the garden, drew pinetags to cover them, and, gradually, as the\\r\\nwinter advanced, heaped the earth over the various piles of roots to\\r\\nkeep them through the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, in September, corn harvest had come on. The four acres Hiram\\r\\nhad planted below the stables yielded a fair crop, that part of the\\r\\nland he had been able to enrich with coarse manure showing a much better\\r\\naverage than the remainder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four acres yielded them something over one hundred and sixty baskets\\r\\nof sound corn which, as corn was then selling for fifty cents per\\r\\nbushel, meant that the crop was worth about forty dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs near as Hiram could figure it had cost about fifteen dollars to raise\\r\\nthe crop; therefore the profit to Mrs. Atterson was some twenty-five\\r\\ndollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the profit from some of the garden crops, this was very small\\r\\nindeed; as Hiram said, it did not pay well enough to plant small patches\\r\\nof corn for them to fool with it much.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The only way to make a good profit out of corn corn a place like this,\"\\r\\nhe said to Henry, who would not be convinced, \"is to have a big drove of\\r\\nhogs and turn them into the field to fatten on the standing corn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that would be wasteful!\" cried Henry, shocked at the suggestion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Big pork producers do not find it so,\" returned Hiram, confidently. \"Or\\r\\nelse one wants a drove of cattle to fatten, and cuts the corn green and\\r\\nshreds it, blowing it into a silo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea is to get the cost of the corn crop back through the price\\r\\npaid by the butcher for your stock, or hogs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody ever did that around here,\" declared young Pollock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that\\'s why nobody gets ahead very fast around here. Henry, why\\r\\ndon\\'t you strike out and do something new--just to surprise \\'em?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop selling a little tad of this, and a little tad of that off the\\r\\nfarm and stick to the good farmer\\'s rule: \\'Never sell anything off the\\r\\nplace that can\\'t walk off.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard that before,\" said Henry, sighing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And even then just so much fertility goes with every yoke of steers\\r\\nor pair of fat hogs. But it is less loss, in proportion, than when the\\r\\ncorn, or oats, or wheat itself is sold.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX. LETTIE BRONSON\\'S CORN HUSKING\\r\\n\\r\\nSister had begun school on the very first day it opened--in September.\\r\\nShe was delighted, for although she had had \"lessons\" at the\\r\\n\"institution\", they had not been like this regular attendance, with\\r\\nother free and happy children, at a good country school.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister was growing not alone in body, but in mind. And the improvement\\r\\nin her appearance was something marvelous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly does astonish me, every time I think o\\' that youngun\\r\\nand the way she looked when she come to me from the charity school,\"\\r\\ndeclared Mother Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'d want a better lookin\\' young\\'un now? She\\'d be the pride of any\\r\\nmother\\'s heart, she\\'d be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If there\\'s folks belongin\\' to her, and they have neglected her all\\r\\nthese years, in my opinion they\\'re lackin\\' in sense, Hiram.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They certainly have been lacking in the milk of human kindness,\"\\r\\nadmitted the young farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Huh! That milk\\'s easily soured in many folks,\" responded Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson. \"But Sister\\'s folks, whoever they be, will be sorry some day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t suppose she really has any family, do you?\" demanded Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No father nor mother, I expect. But many a family will get rid of\\r\\na young\\'un too small to be of any use, when they probably have many\\r\\nchildren of their own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if there was a little bait of money coming to the child, as that\\r\\nlawyer told the institution matron, that would be another reason for\\r\\nlosing her in this great world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m afraid Sister will never find her folks, Mrs. Atterson,\" said\\r\\nHiram, shaking his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Huh! If she don\\'t, it\\'s no loss to her. It\\'s loss to them,\" declared\\r\\nthe old lady. \"And I\\'d hate to have anybody come and take her away from\\r\\nus now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSister no longer wore her short hair in four \"pigtails\". She had learned\\r\\nto dress it neatly like other girls of her age, and although it would\\r\\nnever be like the beautiful blue-black tresses of Lettie Bronson, Hiram\\r\\nhad to admit that the soft brown of Sister\\'s hair, waving so prettily\\r\\nover her forehead, made the girl\\'s features more than a little\\r\\nattractive.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an entirely different person, too, from the one who had helped\\r\\nLettie and her friends ashore from the grounded motor-boat that day, so\\r\\nlong ago--and so Lettie herself thought when she rode into the Atterson\\r\\nyard one October day on her bay horse, and Sister met her on the porch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you\\'re Mrs. Atterson\\'s girl, aren\\'t you?\" cried Lettie, leaning\\r\\nfrom her saddle to offer her hand to Sister. \"I wouldn\\'t have known\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSister was getting plump, she had roses in her cheeks, and she wore a\\r\\nneat, whole, and becoming dress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re Miss Bronson,\" said Sister, gravely. \"I wouldn\\'t forget you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps there was something in what Sister said that stung Lettie\\r\\nBronson\\'s memory. She flushed a little; but then she smiled most\\r\\ncharmingly and asked for Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Husking corn, Miss, with Henry Pollock, down on the bottom-land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! way down there? Well! you tell him--Why, I\\'ll want you to come,\\r\\ntoo,\" laughed Lettie, quite at her best now.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody could fail to answer Lettie Bronson\\'s smile with its reflection,\\r\\nwhen she chose to exert herself in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I just came to tell you both that on Friday we\\'re going to have an\\r\\nold-fashioned husking-bee for all the young folks of the neighborhood,\\r\\nat our place. You must come yourself--er--Sister, and tell Hiram to\\r\\ncome, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seven o\\'clock, sharp, remember--and I\\'ll be dreadfully disappointed if\\r\\nyou don\\'t come,\" added Lettie, turning her horse\\'s head homeward, and\\r\\nsaying it with so much cordiality that her hearer\\'s heart warmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is pretty,\" mused Sister, watching the bay horse and its rider\\r\\nflying along the road. \"I don\\'t blame Hiram for thinking she\\'s the very\\r\\nfinest girl in these parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is,\" declared Sister, emphatically, and shook herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had finished husking the lowland corn that day, with Henry\\'s help,\\r\\nand it was all drawn in at night. When the last measured basket was\\r\\nheaped in the crib by lantern light, the young farmer added up the\\r\\nfigures chalked up on the lintel of the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For goodness\\' sake, Hiram! it isn\\'t as much as that, is it?\" gasped\\r\\nHenry, viewing the figures the young farmer wrote proudly in his\\r\\nmemorandum book.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Six acres--six hundred and eighty baskets of sound corn,\" crowed\\r\\n\"Hiram. And it\\'s corn that is corn, as Mr. Bronson says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s not quite as hard as the upland corn, for the growing season was\\r\\nnot quite long enough for it; but it\\'s better than the average in the\\r\\ncounty----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three hundred and forty bushel of shelled corn from six acres?\" cried\\r\\nHenry. \"I should say it was! It\\'s worth fifty cents now right at the\\r\\ncrib--a hundred and seventy dollars. Hiram! that\\'ll make dad let me go\\r\\nto the agricultural college.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" cried Hiram, surprised and pleased. \"Have you really got that\\r\\nidea in your head?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I been gnawin\\' on it ever since you talked so last spring,\" admitted\\r\\nhis friend, rather shyly. \"I told father, and at first he pooh-poohed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I kept on pointing out to him how much more you knowed than we\\r\\ndid--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s nonsense, Henry,\" interrupted Hiram. \"Only about some things. I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t want to set myself up over the farmers of this neighborhood as\\r\\nknowing so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you\\'ve proved it. Dad says so himself. He was taken all aback\\r\\nwhen I showed him how you had beat him on the tomato crop. And I been\\r\\ntalking to him about your corn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That hit father where he lived,\" chuckled Henry, \"for father\\'s a\\r\\ncorn-growing man--and always has been considered so in this county.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He watched the way you tilled your crop, and he believed so much\\r\\nshallow cultivating was wrong, and said so. But he says you beat him\\r\\non poor ground; and when I tell him what that lowland figures up, he\\'ll\\r\\nthrow up his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I\\'m going to take a course in fertilizers, farm management, and the\\r\\nchemistry of soils,\" continued Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you say, I believe we have been planting the wrong crops on the\\r\\nright land! Anyway, I\\'ll find out. I believe we\\'ve got a good farm, but\\r\\nwe\\'re not getting out of it what we should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Henry,\" admitted Hiram, slowly, \"nothing\\'s pleased me so much\\r\\nsince I came into this neighborhood, as to hear you say this. You get\\r\\nall you can at the experiment station this winter, and I believe that\\r\\nyour father will soon begin to believe that there is something in \\'book\\r\\nfarming\\', after all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it had not been for the hair-hung sword over them, Mrs. Atterson and\\r\\nHiram would have taken great delight in the generous crops that had been\\r\\nvouchsafed to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still, we can\\'t complain,\" said the old lady, \"and for the first time\\r\\nfor more\\'n twenty years I\\'m going to be really thankful at Thanksgiving\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I believe you!\" cried Sister, who heard her. \"No boarders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nope,\" said the old lady, quietly. \"You\\'re wrong. For we\\'re going\\r\\nto have boarders on Thanksgiving Day. I\\'ve writ to Crawberry. Anybody\\r\\nthat\\'s in the old house now that wants to come to eat dinner with us,\\r\\ncan come. I\\'m going to cook the best dinner I ever cooked--and make a\\r\\nmilkpail full of gravy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" said the good old soul, shaking her head, \"that them two old\\r\\nmaids I sold out to have half starved them boys. We ought to be able to\\r\\nstand even Fred Crackit, and Mr. Peebles, one day in the year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well!\" returned Sister, thoughtfully. \"If you can stand \\'em I can. I\\r\\nnever did think I could forgive \\'em all--so mean they was to me--and the\\r\\nhair-pulling and all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I guess you\\'re right, Mis\\' Atterson. It\\'s heapin\\' coals of fire on\\r\\ntheir heads, like what the minister at the chapel says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Land o\\' Goshen, child!\" exclaimed the old lady, briskly. \"Hot\\r\\ncoals would scotch \\'em, and I only want to fill their stomachs for\\r\\nonce.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe husking at the Bronsons was a very well attended feast, indeed.\\r\\nThere was a great barn floor, and on this were heaped the ear-corn in\\r\\nthe husks--not too much, for Lettie proposed having the floor cleared\\r\\nand swept for square dancing, and later for the supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a lot of her school friends at the husking, and at first the\\r\\nneighborhood boys and girls were bashful in the company of the city\\r\\ngirls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after they got to work husking the corn, and a few red ears had been\\r\\nfound (for which each girl or boy had to pay a forfeit) they became a\\r\\nvery hilarious company indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Lettie, broadly hospitable, had invited the young folk far and\\r\\nwide. Even those whom she had not personally seen, were expected to\\r\\nattend.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it was not surprising that Pete Dickerson should come, despite the\\r\\nfact that Mr. Bronson had once discharged him from his employ--and for\\r\\nserious cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Pete was not a thin-skinned person. Where there was anything \"doing\"\\r\\nhe wanted to cut a figure. And his desire to be important, and be marked\\r\\nby the company, began to make him objectionable before the evening was\\r\\nhalf over.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, he thought it was funny to take a run down the long barn\\r\\nfloor and leap over the heads of those huskers squatting about a heap\\r\\nof corn, and land with his heavy boots on the apex of the pile, thus\\r\\nscattering the ears in all directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got long straws, too, and tickled the backs, of the girls\\' necks; or\\r\\nhe dumped handfuls of bran down their backs, or shook oats into their\\r\\nhair--and the oats stuck.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bronson could not see to everything; and Pete was very sly at his\\r\\ntricks. A girl would shriek in one corner, and the lout would quickly\\r\\ntransport himself to a distant spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the corn was swept aside, and the floor cleared for the dance, Pete\\r\\nwent beyond the limit, however. He had found a pail of soft-soap in the\\r\\nshed and while the crowd was out of the barn, playing a \"round game\"\\r\\nin the yard while it was being swept, Pete slunk in with the soap and a\\r\\nswab, and managed to spread a good deal of the slippery stuff around on\\r\\nthe boards.\\r\\n\\r\\nA broom would not remove this soft-soap. When the hostler swept, he\\r\\nonly spread it. And when the dancing began many a couple measured their\\r\\nlength on the planks, to Pete\\'s great delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the hired man had observed Pete sneaking about while he was removing\\r\\nthe last of the corn, and Hiram Strong discovered soft-soap on Pete\\'s\\r\\nclothes, and the smell of it strong upon his unwashed hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You get out of here,\" Mr. Bronson told the boy. \"I had occasion to put\\r\\nyou off my land once, and don\\'t let me have to do it a third time,\"\\r\\nand he shoved him with no gentle hand through the door and down the\\r\\ndriveway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Pete laid it all to Hiram. He called back over his shoulder:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be square with you, yet, Hi Strong! You wait!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram bad been threatened so often from that quarter by now, that he\\r\\nwas not much interested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX. ONE SNOWY MIDNIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fun went on after that with more moderation, and everybody had a\\r\\npleasant time. That is, so supposed Hiram Strong until, in going out of\\r\\nthe barn again to get a breath of cool air after one of the dances, he\\r\\nalmost stumbled over a figure hiding in a corner, and crying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Sister!\" he cried, taking the girl by the shoulders, and turning\\r\\nher about. \"What\\'s the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I want to go home, Hi. This isn\\'t any place for me. Let me--me\\r\\nrun--run home!\" she sobbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess not! Who\\'s bothered you? Has that Pete Dickerson come back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" sobbed Sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They--they don\\'t want me here. They don\\'t like me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who don\\'t?\" demanded Hiram, sternly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Those--those girls from St. Beris. I--I tried to dance, and I slipped\\r\\non some of that horrid soap and--and fell down. And they said I was\\r\\nclumsy. And one said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, all these country girls are like that. I don\\'t see what Let wanted\\r\\nthem here for.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'So\\'t we could all show off better,\\' said another, laughing some more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I guess that\\'s right enough,\" finished Sister. \"They don\\'t want me\\r\\nhere. Only to make fun of. And I wish I hadn\\'t come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram was smitten dumb for a moment. He had danced once with Lettie, but\\r\\nthe other town girls had given him no opportunity to do so. And it was\\r\\nplain that Lettie\\'s school friends preferred the few boys who had come\\r\\nup from town to any of the farmers\\' sons who had come to the husking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess you\\'re right, Sister. They don\\'t want us--much,\" admitted\\r\\nHiram, slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then let\\'s both go home,\" said Sister, sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. That wouldn\\'t be serving Mr. Bronson--or Lettie--right. We were\\r\\ninvited in good faith, I reckon, and the Bronsons haven\\'t done anything\\r\\nto offend us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you and I\\'ll go back there and dance together. You dance with\\r\\nme--or with Henry; and I\\'ll stick to the country girls. If Lettie\\r\\nBronson\\'s friends from boarding school think they are so much better\\r\\nthan us folks out here in the country, let us show them that we can have\\r\\na good time without them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll go back with you, Hiram,\" cried Sister, gladly, and the young\\r\\nfellow was a bit conscience-stricken as he noted her changed tone and\\r\\nsaw the sparkle that came into her eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad he neglected Sister because Lettie Bronson was about? Well! perhaps\\r\\nhe had. But he made up for it with the attention he paid to Sister\\r\\nduring the remainder of the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went home early, however, and Hiram felt somewhat grave after the\\r\\ncorn husking. Had Lettie Bronson invited the country-bred young folk\\r\\nliving about her father\\'s home, to meet her boarding school friends,\\r\\nand the town boys, merely that the latter might be compared with the\\r\\nfarmer-folk to their disfavor?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not believe that--really. Lettie Bronson might be thoughtless,\\r\\nand a little proud; but she was still a princess to Hiram, and he could\\r\\nnot think this evil of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there were too many duties every day for the young farmer to give\\r\\nmuch thought to such problems. Harvesting was not complete yet, and\\r\\nsoon flurries of snow began to drive across the fields and threaten the\\r\\napproach of winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally the wind came out of the northwest for more than a day, and\\r\\ntoward evening the flakes began to fall, faster and faster, thicker and\\r\\nthicker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s going to be a snowy night--a real baby blizzard,\" declared Hiram,\\r\\nstamping his feet on the porch before coming into the warm kitchen with\\r\\nthe milkpail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear! And I thought you\\'d go over to Pollock\\'s with me to-night,\\r\\nHi,\" said Sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mabel an\\' I are goin\\' to make our Christmas presents together, and\\r\\nshe\\'s expecting me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shucks! \\'Twon\\'t be fit for a girl to go out if it snows,\" said Mother\\r\\nAtterson.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram saw that Sister was much disappointed, and he had tried to be\\r\\nkinder to her since that night of the corn husking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s a little snow?\" he demanded, laughing. \"Bundle up good, Sister,\\r\\nand I\\'ll go over with you. I want to see Henry, anyway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Crazy young\\'uns,\" observed Mother Atterson. But she made no real\\r\\nobjection. Whatever Hiram said was right, in the old lady\\'s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey tramped through the snowy fields with a lantern, and found it\\r\\nhalf-knee deep in some drifts before they arrived at the Pollocks, short\\r\\nas had been the duration of the fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were welcomed vociferously at the neighbor\\'s; preparations were\\r\\nmade for a long evening\\'s fun; for with the snow coming down so steadily\\r\\nthere would be little work done out of doors the following day, so the\\r\\nfamily need not seek their beds early.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pollock children had made a good store of nuts, like the squirrels;\\r\\nand there was plenty of corn to pop, and molasses for candy, or\\r\\ncorn-balls, and red apples to roast, and sweet cider from the casks in\\r\\nthe cellar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe older girls retired to a corner of the wide hearth with their\\r\\nwork-boxes, and Hiram and Henry worked out several problems regarding\\r\\nthe latter\\'s eleven-week course at the agricultural college, which would\\r\\nbegin the following week; while the young ones played games until they\\r\\nfell fast asleep in odd corners of the big kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly midnight, indeed, when Hiram and Sister started home. And\\r\\nit was still snowing, and snowing heavily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll have to get all the plows out to-morrow morning!\" Henry shouted\\r\\nafter them from the porch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was no easy matter to wade home through the heavy drifts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never could have done it without you, Hi,\" declared the girl, when\\r\\nshe finally floundered onto the Atterson porch, panting and laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll take a look around the barns before I come in,\" remarked the\\r\\ncareful young farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a duty he never neglected, no matter how late he went to bed,\\r\\nnor how tired he was. Half way to the barn he halted. A light was waving\\r\\nwildly by the Dickerson back door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a lantern, and Hiram knew that it was being whirled around and\\r\\naround somebody\\'s head. He thought he heard, too, a shouting through the\\r\\nfalling snow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something\\'s wrong over yonder,\" thought the young farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated but for a moment. He had never stepped upon the Dickerson\\r\\nplace, nor spoken to Sam Dickerson since the trouble about the turkeys.\\r\\nThe lantern continued to swing. Eagerly as the snow came down, it could\\r\\nnot blind Hiram to the waving light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got to see about this,\" he muttered, and started as fast as he\\r\\ncould go through the drifts, across the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon he heard the voice shouting. It was Sam Dickerson. And he evidently\\r\\nhad been shouting to Hiram, seeing his lantern in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Help, Strong! Help!\" he called.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it, man?\" demanded Hiram, climbing the last pair of bars and\\r\\nstruggling through the drifts in the dooryard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you take my horse and go for the doctor? I don\\'t know where Pete\\r\\nis--down to Cale Schell\\'s, I expect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Mr. Dickerson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sarah\\'s fell down the bark stairs--fell backward. Struck her head an\\'\\r\\nain\\'t spoke since. Will you go, Mr. Strong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly. Which horse will I take?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bay\\'s saddled-under the shed--get any doctor--I don\\'t care which\\r\\none. But get him here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, Mr. Dickerson. Leave it to me,\" promised Hiram, and ran to the\\r\\nshed at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI. \"MR. DAMOCLES\\'S SWORD\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram Strong was not likely to forget that long and arduous night. It\\r\\nwas impossible to force the horse out of a walk, for the drifts were in\\r\\nsome places to the creature\\'s girth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped at the house for a minute and roused Mrs. Atterson and Old\\r\\nLem and sent them over to help the unhappy Dickersons.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was nearly an hour getting to the crossroads store. There were lights\\r\\nand revelry there. Some of the lingering crowd were snowbound for the\\r\\nnight and were making merry with hard cider and provisions which Schell\\r\\nwas not loath to sell them.\\r\\n\\r\\nPete was one of the number, and Hiram sent him home with the news of his\\r\\nmother\\'s serious hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe forced the horse to take him into town to Dr. Broderick. It was\\r\\nnearly two o\\'clock when he routed out the doctor, and it was four\\r\\no\\'clock when the physician and himself, in a heavy sleigh and behind a\\r\\npair of mules, reached the Dickerson farmhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman had not returned to consciousness, and Mrs. Atterson remained\\r\\nthrough the day to do what she could. But it was many a tedious week\\r\\nbefore Mrs. Dickerson was on her feet again, and able to move about.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, more than one kindly act had Mother Atterson done for the\\r\\nneighbors who had seemed so careless of her rights. Pete never appeared\\r\\nwhen either Mrs. Atterson or Sister came to the house; but in his sour,\\r\\ngloomy way, Sam Dickerson seemed to be grateful.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram kept away, as there was nothing he could do to help them. And he\\r\\nsaw when Pete chanced to pass him, that the youth felt no more kindly\\r\\ntoward him than he had before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let him be as ugly as he wants to be--only let him keep away from\\r\\nthe place and let our things alone,\" thought Hiram. \"Goodness knows! I\\'m\\r\\nnot anxious to be counted among Pete Dickerson\\'s particular friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThanksgiving came on apace, and every one of the old boarders of\\r\\nMother Atterson had written that he would come to the farm to spend the\\r\\nholiday. Even Mr. Peebles acknowledged the invitation with thanks, but\\r\\nadding that he hoped Sister would not forget he must \"eschew any viands\\r\\nat all greasy, and that his hot water was to be at 101, exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The poor ninny!\" ejaculated Mother Atterson. \"He doesn\\'t know what he\\r\\nwants. Sister only poured it out of the teakettle, and he had to wait\\r\\nfor it to cool, anyway, before he could drink it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was determined to give the city folk a good time, and this\\r\\ndetermination was accomplished. Two of Sister\\'s turkeys, bought and\\r\\npaid for in hard cash by Mother Atterson, graced the long table in the\\r\\nsitting-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the good things with which the table was laden came from the\\r\\nfarm. And, without Hiram and Sister, and Old Lem Camp, Mrs. Atterson\\r\\nmade even Fred Crackit understand, these good things had not been\\r\\npossible!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Crawberry folk, as a whole, were much subdued. They had missed\\r\\nMother Atterson dreadfully; and, really, they had felt some affection\\r\\nfor their old landlady, after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner Fred Crackit, in a speech that was designed to be humorous,\\r\\npresented a massive silver plated water-pitcher with \"Mother Atterson\"\\r\\nengraved upon it. And really, the old lady broke down at that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Land o\\' Goshen!\" she exclaimed. \"Why, you boys do think something\\r\\nof the old woman, after all, don\\'t ye?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must say that I got ye out here more than anything to show ye what we\\r\\ncould do in the country. \\'Specially how it had improved Sister. And how\\r\\nHiram Strong warn\\'t the ninny you seemed to think he was. And that Mr.\\r\\nCamp only needed a chance to be something in the world again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well! It wasn\\'t a generous feeling I had toward you, mebbe; but\\r\\nI\\'m glad you come and--I hope you all had enough gravy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the occasion proved a very pleasant one indeed. And it made a happy\\r\\nbreak in the hard work of preparing for the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crops were all gathered ere this, and they could make up their books\\r\\nfor the season just passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was wood to get in, for all along they had not had wood\\r\\nenough, and to try and get wood out of the snowy forest in winter for\\r\\nimmediate use in the stoves was a task that Hiram did not enjoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had Henry to help him saw a goodly pile before the first snow fell;\\r\\nand Mr. Camp split most of it and he and Sister piled it in the shed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve got to haul up enough logs by March--or earlier--to have a wood\\r\\nsawing in earnest,\" announced Hiram. \"We must get a gasoline engine and\\r\\nsaw, and call on the neighbors for help, and have a sawing-bee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what will be the use of that if we\\'ve got to leave here in\\r\\nFebruary?\" demanded Mrs. Atterson, worriedly. \"The last time I saw that\\r\\nPepper in town he grinned at me in a way that made me want to break my\\r\\nold umbrel\\' over his dratted head!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care,\" said Hiram, sullenly. \"I don\\'t want to sit idle all\\r\\nwinter. I\\'ll cut the logs, anyway, and draw \\'em out from time to time.\\r\\nIf we have to leave, why, we have to, that\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And we can\\'t tell a thing to do about next year till we know what\\r\\nPepper is going to do,\" groaned Mrs. Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true. But if he doesn\\'t exercise his option before\\r\\nFebruary tenth, we needn\\'t worry any more. And after that will be time\\r\\nenough to make our plans for next season\\'s crops,\" declared Hiram,\\r\\ntrying to speak more cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs. Atterson went around with clouded brow again, and was heard to\\r\\nwhisper, more than once, something about \"Mr. Damocles\\'s sword.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII. THE CLOUD IS LIFTED\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite Hiram Strong\\'s warning to his employer when they started work\\r\\non the old Atterson Eighty, that she must expect no profit for this\\r\\nseason\\'s, work, the Christmas-tide, when they settled their accounts for\\r\\nthe year, proved the young fellow to have been a bad prophet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Hiram, after I pay you this hundred dollars, I shall have a little\\r\\nmoney left--I shall indeed. And all that corn in the crib--and stacks of\\r\\nfodder, beside the barn loft full, and the roots, and the chickens, and\\r\\nthe pork, and the calf----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Hiram! I\\'m a richer woman to-day than when I came out here to the\\r\\nfarm, that\\'s sure. How do you account for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had to admit that they had been favored beyond his expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If that Pepper man would only come for\\'ard and say what he was going to\\r\\ndo!\" sighed Mother Atterson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the continual complaint now. As the winter advanced all four\\r\\nof the family bore the option in mind continually. There was talk of the\\r\\nrailroad going before the Legislature to ask for the condemnation of the\\r\\nproperty it needed, in the spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed pretty well settled that the survey along the edge of the\\r\\nAtterson Eighty would be the route selected. And, if that was the case,\\r\\nwhy did Pepper not try to exercise his option?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Strickland had said that there was no way by which the real estate\\r\\nman\\'s hand could be forced; so they had to abide Pepper\\'s pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we only knew we\\'d stay,\" said Hiram, \"I\\'d cut a few well grown pine\\r\\ntrees, while I am cutting the firewood, have them dragged to the mill,\\r\\nand saw the boards we shall need if we go into the celery business this\\r\\ncoming season.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want boards for?\" demanded Henry, who chanced to be home\\r\\nover Christmas, and was at the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For bleaching. Saves time, room, and trouble. Banking celery, even with\\r\\na plow, is not alone old-fashioned, and cumbersome, but is apt to leave\\r\\nthe blanched celery much dirtier.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you\\'ll need an awful lot of board for six acres, Hiram!\" gasped\\r\\nHenry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know. I shall run the trenches four feet apart, and you mustn\\'t\\r\\nsuppose, Henry, that I shall blanch all six acres at once. The boards\\r\\ncan be used over and over again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t think of that,\" admitted his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry was eagerly interested in his selected studies at the experiment\\r\\nstation and college, and Abel Pollock followed his son\\'s work there with\\r\\ngrowing approval, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It does beat all,\" he admitted to Hiram, \"what that boy has learned\\r\\nalready about practical things. Book-farming ain\\'t all flapdoodle,\\r\\nthat\\'s sure!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the year ended--quietly, peacefully, and with no little happiness\\r\\nin the Atterson farmhouse, despite the cloud that overshadowed the\\r\\nfarm-title, and the doubts which faced them about the next season\\'s\\r\\nwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat up on New Year\\'s eve to see the old year out and the new in,\\r\\nand had a merry evening although there were only the family. When the\\r\\ndistant whistles blew at midnight they went out upon the back porch to\\r\\nlisten.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a dark night, for thick clouds shrouded the stars. Only the\\r\\nunbroken coverlet of snow (it had fallen that morning) aided them to see\\r\\nabout the empty fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the far distance was the twinkle of a single light--that in an upper\\r\\nchamber of the Pollock house. Dickersons\\' was mantled in shadow, and\\r\\nthose two houses were the only ones in sight of the Atterson place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I was afraid when we came out here that I\\'d be dead of loneliness\\r\\nin a month--with no near neighbors,\" admitted Mother Atterson. \"But I\\'ve\\r\\nbeen so busy that I ain\\'t never minded it----\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that light, Hiram?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer cry was echoed by Sister. Behind the bam a sudden glow was spreading\\r\\nagainst the low-hung clouds. It was too far away for one of their\\r\\nout-buildings to be afire; but Hiram set off immediately, although he\\r\\nonly had slippers on, for the corner of the barnyard fence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he reached this point he saw that one of the fodder stacks in the\\r\\ncornfield was afire. The whole top of the stack was ablaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" cried Sister, who had followed him. \"What can we\\r\\ndo?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing,\", said Hiram. \"There\\'s no wind, and it won\\'t spread to another\\r\\nstack. But that one is past redemption, for sure!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram hastened back to the house and put on his boots. But he did not\\r\\nwade through the snow to the fodder stack that was burning so briskly.\\r\\nHe merely made a detour around it, at some yards distant. Nowhere did he\\r\\nsee the mark of a footprint.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow the stack had been set afire was a mystery. Hiram had stacked the\\r\\nfodder himself, with the help of Sister, who had pitched the bundles up\\r\\nto him. The young farmer did not smoke, and he seldom carried matches\\r\\nloose in his pockets.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the idea that he had dropped a match in the fodder and a\\r\\nfield mouse, burrowing for some nubbin of corn, had come across the\\r\\nmatch, nibbled the head, and so set the blaze, was scarcely feasible.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, how else had the fire started?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen daylight came Hiram could find no footprint near the stack--only\\r\\nhis own where he had circled it while it was blazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the stack nearest to the Dickerson line. Hiram, naturally,\\r\\nthought of Pete.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Mrs. Dickerson\\'s sickness, Mother Atterson had been back and forth\\r\\nto help her neighbor, and whenever Sam Dickerson saw Hiram he was as\\r\\nfriendly as it was in the nature of the man to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram could not believe that Pete\\'s father would now countenance any\\r\\nof his son\\'s meannesses; yet when the young farmer went along the line\\r\\nfence, he saw fresh tracks across the Dickerson fields, and discovered\\r\\nwhere the person had stood, on the Dickerson side of the fence opposite\\r\\nthe burned fodder stack.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these footprints were all of three hundred feet from the stack, and\\r\\nthere was not a mark in the snow upon Hiram\\'s side of the fence, saving\\r\\nhis own footprints.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maybe somebody merely ran across to look at the blaze. But it\\'s strange\\r\\nI did not see him,\" thought Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not help being suspicious, however, and he prowled about the\\r\\nstacks and the barns more than ever at night. He could not shake off the\\r\\nfeeling that the enemy in the dark was at work again.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary passed, and the fatal day--the tenth of February--drew nearer\\r\\nand nearer. If Pepper proposed to exercise his option he must do it on\\r\\nor before that date.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Hiram nor Mrs. Atterson had seen the real estate man of late;\\r\\nbut they had seen Mr. Strickland, and on the final day they drove to\\r\\ntown to meet Pepper--if the man was going to show up--in the lawyer\\'s\\r\\noffice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t trouble him, if I were you,\" advised the lawyer. \"But if you\\r\\ninsist, I\\'ll send over for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know what he means by all this,\" declared Mrs. Atterson,\\r\\nangrily. \"He\\'s kept me on tenter-hooks for ten months, and there ought\\r\\nto be some punishment for the crime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid he has been within his rights,\" said the lawyer, smiling;\\r\\nbut he sent his clerk for the real estate man, probably being very well\\r\\nconvinced of the outcome of the affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn came the snaky Mr. Pepper. The moment he saw Mrs. Atterson and Hiram\\r\\nhe began to cackle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye don\\'t mean to say you come clean in here this stormy day to try and\\r\\nsell that farm to me?\" asked the real estate man. \"No, ma\\'am! Not for no\\r\\nsixteen hundred dollars. If you\\'ll take twelve----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson could not find words to reply to him; and Hiram felt like\\r\\nseizing the scoundrel by the scruff of his neck and throwing him down to\\r\\nthe street. But it was Mr. Strickland who interposed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you do not propose to exercise your option?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed-y!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long since did you give up the idea of purchasing the Atterson\\r\\nplace?\" asked the lawyer, curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pshaw! I gave up the idee \\'way back there last spring,\" chuckled\\r\\nPepper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You haven\\'t the paper with you, have you, Mr. Pepper?\" asked Mr.\\r\\nStrickland, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real estate man looked wondrous sly and tapped the side of his nose\\r\\nwith a lean finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I tore up that old paper long ago. It warn\\'t no good to me,\" said\\r\\nPepper. \"I wouldn\\'t take the farm at that price for a gift,\" and he\\r\\ndeparted with a sneering smile upon his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And well he did destroy it,\" declared Mr. Strickland. \"It was a\\r\\nforgery--that is what it was. And if we could have once got Pepper in\\r\\ncourt with it, he would not have turned another scaly trick for some\\r\\nyears to come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII. \"CELERY MAD\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relief to the minds of Hiram Strong and Mrs. Atterson was\\r\\ntremendous.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially was the young farmer inspired to greater effort. He saw the\\r\\nsecond growing season before him. And he saw, too, that now, indeed,\\r\\nhe had that chance to prove his efficiency which he had desired all the\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe past year had cost him little for clothing or other expenses. He had\\r\\nbanked the hundred dollars Mrs. Atterson had paid him at Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he looked forward to something much bigger than the other hundred\\r\\nwhen the next Christmas-tide should come. Twenty-five per cent of all\\r\\nthe profit of the Atterson Eighty during this second year was to be his\\r\\nown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment \"Mr. Damocles\\'s sword\", as Mother Atterson had called it, was\\r\\nlifted the young farmer jumped into the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had already cut enough wood to last the family a year; now he got Mr.\\r\\nPollock, with his team of mules, to haul it up to the house, and then\\r\\nsent for the power saw, asked the neighbors to help, and in less than\\r\\nhalf a day every stick was cut to stove length.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he had time Hiram split this wood and Lem Camp piled it in the shed.\\r\\nHiram knocked together some extra cold-frames, too, and bought some\\r\\nsecond-hand sash.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he had already dug a pit for a twelve-foot hotbed. Now, a\\r\\ntwelve-foot hotbed will start an enormous number of plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram did not plan to have quite so much small stuff in the garden this\\r\\nyear, however. He knew that he should have less time to work in the\\r\\ngarden. He proposed having more potatoes, about as many tomatoes as the\\r\\nyear before, but fewer roots to bunch, salads and the like. He must give\\r\\nthe bulk of his time to the big commercial crop that he hoped to put\\r\\ninto the bottom-land.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had little fear of the river overflowing its banks late enough in the\\r\\nseason to interfere with the celery crop. For the seedlings were to be\\r\\nhandled in the cold-frames and garden-patch until it was time to set\\r\\nthem in the trenches. And that would not be until July.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe contented himself with having the logs he cut drawn to the sawmill\\r\\nand the sawed planks brought down to the edge of the bottom-land, and\\r\\ndid not propose to put a plow into the land until late June.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile he started his celery seed in shallow boxes, and when the\\r\\nplants were an inch and a half, or so, tall, he pricked them out, two\\r\\ninches apart each way into the cold-frames.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister and Mr. Camp could help in this work, and they soon filled the\\r\\ncold-frames with celery plants destined to be reset in the garden plat\\r\\nlater.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis \"handling\" of celery aids its growth and development in a most\\r\\nwonderful manner. At the second transplanting, Hiram snipped back the\\r\\ntops, and the roots as well, so that each plant would grow sturdily and\\r\\nnot be too \"stalky\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson declared they were all celery mad. \"Whatever will you do\\r\\nwith so much of the stuff, I haven\\'t the least idee, Hiram. Can you sell\\r\\nit all? Why, it looks to me as though you had set out enough already to\\r\\nglut the Crawberry market.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I guess that\\'s right,\" returned Hiram. \"Especially if I shipped it\\r\\nall at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was aiming higher than the Crawberry market. He had been in\\r\\ncorrespondence with firms that handled celery exclusively in some of the\\r\\nbig cities, and before ever he put the plow into the bottom-land he\\r\\nhad arranged for the marketing of every stalk he could grow on his six\\r\\nacres.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a truth that the family of transplanted boarding house people\\r\\nworked harder this second spring than they had the first one. But they\\r\\nknew how better, too, and the garden work did not seem so arduous to\\r\\nSister and Old Lem Camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Atterson had a fine flock of hens, and they had laid well after the\\r\\nfirst of December, and the eggs had brought good prices. She planned to\\r\\nincrease her flock, build larger yards, and in time make a business of\\r\\npoultry raising, as that would be something that she and Sister could\\r\\npractically handle alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSister\\'s turkeys had thrived so the year before that she had saved two\\r\\nhens and a handsome gobbler, and determined to breed turkeys for the\\r\\nfall market.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Sister learned a few things before she had raised \"that raft\\r\\nof poults,\" as Mother Atterson called them. Turkeys are certainly\\r\\ncalculated to breed patience--especially if one expects to have a flock\\r\\nof young Toms and hens fit for killing at Thanksgiving-time.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hatched the turkeys under motherly hens belonging to Mother\\r\\nAtterson, striving to breed poults that would not trail so far from the\\r\\nhouse; but as soon as the youngsters began to feel their wings they had\\r\\ntheir foster-mothers pretty well worn out. One flock tolled the old hen\\r\\noff at least a mile from the house and Hiram had some work enticing the\\r\\npoults back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no raid made upon her turkey coops this year, however. Pete\\r\\nDickerson was not much in evidence during the spring and early summer.\\r\\nMrs. Atterson went back and forth to the neighbors; but although\\r\\nwhenever Hiram saw the farmer the latter put forth an effort to be\\r\\npleasant to him, the two households did not well \"mix\".\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, during this busiest time of the year, when the crops were\\r\\ngetting started, there seemed to be little opportunity for social\\r\\nintercourse. At least, so it seemed on the Atterson place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were a busy and well contented crew, and everything seemed to be\\r\\nrunning like clockwork, when suddenly \"another dish of trouble\", as\\r\\nMother Atterson called it, was served them in a most unexpected manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram was coming up from the barn one evening, long after dark, and had\\r\\njust caught sight of Sister standing on the porch waiting for him, when\\r\\na sudden glow against the dark sky, made him turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flash of fire passed on the instant, and Sister called to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Hiram! did you see that shooting-star?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You never wished on it, Sis,\" said the young farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes I did!\" she returned, dancing down the steps to meet him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That quick?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just that quick,\" she reiterated, seizing his arm and getting into step\\r\\nwith him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what was the wish?\" demanded Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why--I won\\'t ever get it if I tell you, will I?\" she queried, shyly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as likely to as not, Sister,\" he said, with serious voice. \"Wishes\\r\\nare funny things, you know. Sometimes the very best ones never come\\r\\ntrue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I\\'m afraid mine will never come true,\" she sighed. \"Oh, dear! I\\r\\nguess no amount of wishing will ever bring some things to pass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maybe that\\'s so, Sis,\" he said, chuckling. \"I fancy that getting out\\r\\nand hustling for the thing you want is the best way to fulfill wishes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but I can\\'t do that in this case,\" said the girl, shaking her head,\\r\\nand still speaking very seriously as they came to the porch steps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maybe I can bring it about for you,\" teased Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess not,\" she said. \"I want so to be like other girls, Hiram! I\\'d\\r\\nlike to be like that pretty Lettie Bronson. I\\'m not jealous of her\\r\\nlooks and her clothes and her good times and all; no, that\\'s not it,\"\\r\\nproclaimed Sister, with a little break in her voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I\\'d like to know who I really be. I want folks, and--and I want to\\r\\nhave a real name of my own!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, bless you!\" exclaimed the young fellow, \"\\'Sister\\' is a nice name,\\r\\nI\\'m sure--and we all love it here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it isn\\'t a name. They call me Sissy Atterson at school. But it\\r\\ndoesn\\'t belong to me. I--I\\'ve thought lots about choosing a name for\\r\\nmyself--a real fancy one, you know. There\\'s lots of pretty, names,\" she\\r\\nsaid, reflectively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cords of \\'em,\" Hiram agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, you see, they wouldn\\'t really be mine,\" said the girl, earnestly.\\r\\n\"Not even after I had chosen them. I want my very own name! I want to\\r\\nknow who I am and all about myself. And\"--with a half strangled sob--\"I\\r\\nguess wishing will never bring me that, will it, Hiram?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNever before had the young fellow heard Sister express herself upon this\\r\\ntopic. He had no idea that the girl felt her unknown and practically\\r\\nunnamed existence so strongly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t care, Sis,\" he said, patting her bent shoulders. \"We love\\r\\nyou here just as well as we would if you had ten names! Don\\'t forget\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And maybe it won\\'t be all a mystery some day. Your folks may look you\\r\\nup. They may come here and find you. And they\\'ll be mighty proud of\\r\\nyou--you\\'ve grown so tall and good looking. Of course they will!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSister listened to him and gave a little contented sigh. \"And then they\\r\\nmight want to take me away--and I\\'d fight, tooth and nail, if they tried\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" gasped Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I would!\" said the girl. \"Do you suppose I\\'d give up Mother\\r\\nAtterson for a dozen families--or for clothes--and houses--or, or\\r\\nanything?\" and she ran into the house leaving the young farmer in some\\r\\namazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ain\\'t that the girl of it?\" he muttered, at last. \"Yet I bet she is in\\r\\nearnest about wanting to know about her folks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd from that time Hiram thought more about Sister\\'s problem himself\\r\\nthan he had before. Once, when he went to Crawberry, he went to the\\r\\ncharitable institution from which Mother Atterson had taken Sister. But\\r\\nthe matron had heard nothing of the lawyer who had once come to talk\\r\\nover the child\\'s affairs, and the path of inquiry seemed shut off right\\r\\nthere by an impassable barrier.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this is ahead of our story. On this particular night Hiram\\r\\nwashed at the pump, and then followed Sister in to supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they were half through Mr. Camp suddenly started from his chair\\r\\nand pointed through the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlames were rising behind the barn again!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another stack burning!\" exclaimed Hiram, and be shot out of the door,\\r\\nseizing a pail of water, hoping that he might put it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the stack was doomed. He knew it the moment he saw the extent of the\\r\\nblaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe kept away from it, as he had before; yet he did not expect to pick up\\r\\nany trail of the incendiary near the stack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twice in the same place is too much!\" declared the young farmer,\\r\\nglowing with wrath. \"I\\'m going to have this mystery explained, or know\\r\\nthe reason why.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe left Mr. Camp to watch the burning fodder, to see that sparks from\\r\\nthe stack did no harm, and lighting his lantern he went along the line\\r\\nfence again.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes! there were the footprints that he had expected to find. But the\\r\\nburning stack was even farther from the fence than the first one\\r\\nhad been--and there were no marks of feet in the soft earth on Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson\\'s side of the boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV. CLEANING UP A PROFIT\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram crawled through the wires, and followed the plain foot-marks back\\r\\nto the Dickerson sheds. He lost them there, of course, but he knew by\\r\\nthe size of the footprints that either Sam Dickerson or his oldest son\\r\\nhad been over to the line fence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that shooting-star!\" considered Hiram. \"There was something peculiar\\r\\nabout that. I wonder if there wasn\\'t a shooting star, also, away back\\r\\nthere at New Year\\'s when our other stack of fodder was burned?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe loitered about the sheds for a few moments. It appeared as though all\\r\\nthe Dickersons were indoors. Nobody interfered with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf a sudden Hiram began to sniff an odor that seemed strange about a\\r\\ncart-shed. At least, no wise farmer would have naphtha, or gasoline, in\\r\\nhis outbuildings, for it would make his insurance invalid.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that was the smell Hiram discovered. And he was not long in finding\\r\\nthe cause of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in a dark corner, upon a beam, lay a big sling-shot--one of those\\r\\nthat boys swing around their heads with a stone in the heel of it, and\\r\\nthen let go one end to shoot the missile to a distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leather loop was saturated with the gasoline, and it had been\\r\\nscorched, too. The smell of burning, as well as the smell of gasoline,\\r\\nwas very distinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram took the sling-shot with him, and went up to the Dickerson house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had got along so well with the Dickersons for these past months\\r\\nthat he honestly shrank from \"starting anything\" now. Yet he could not\\r\\noverlook this flagrant piece of malicious mischief. Indeed, it was more\\r\\nthan that. Two stacks had already been burned, and it might be some of\\r\\nthe outbuildings--or even Mrs. Atterson\\'s house--next time!\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, Hiram felt himself responsible for his employer\\'s property. The\\r\\nold lady could not afford to lose the fodder, and Hiram was determined\\r\\nthat both of the burned stacks should be paid for in full.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked through the window of the Dickerson kitchen. The family was\\r\\naround the supper table-Mr. and Mrs. Dickerson, Pete, and the children,\\r\\nlittle and big. It was a cheerful family group, after all. Rough and\\r\\nuncouth as the farmer was, Dickerson likely had his feelings like other\\r\\npeople. Instead of bursting right in at the door as had been Hiram\\'s\\r\\nintention, and accusing Pete to his face, the indignant young fellow\\r\\nhesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hadn\\'t any sympathy for Pete, not the slightest. If he gave him--or\\r\\nthe elder Dickerson--a chance to clear up matters by making good to Mrs.\\r\\nAtterson for what she had lost, Hiram Strong decided that he was being\\r\\nvery lenient indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped quietly onto the porch and rapped on the door. Then he backed\\r\\noff and waited for some response from within.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hullo, Mr. Strong!\" exclaimed the farmer, coming himself to the \"door.\\r\\nWhy! is that your stack burning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Hiram, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another one!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the second,\" admitted Hiram. \"But I don\\'t propose that another\\r\\nshall be set afire in just the same way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSam Dickerson stepped suddenly down to the young farmer\\'s level, and\\r\\nasked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean by that? Do you know how it got afire?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram held out the sling-shot in the light of his lantern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A rag, saturated with gasoline, was wrapped around a pebble, then set\\r\\nafire, and stone and blazing rag were shot from our line fence into the\\r\\nfodderstack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found the footprints of the incendiary on New Year\\'s morning at the\\r\\nsame place. And I\\'ll wager a good deal that your son Pete\\'s boots will\\r\\nfit the footprints over there at the line now!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSam Dickerson\\'s face had turned exceedingly red, and then paled. But he\\r\\nspoke very quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you going to do with him, Mr. Strong?\" he asked. \"It will be\\r\\nfive years for him at least, if you take it to court--and maybe longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe, Mr. Dickerson, that you have upheld Pete in all the\\r\\nmean tricks he has played on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I haven\\'t! And since I got a look at myself--back there when the\\r\\nwife was hurt----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSam Dickerson\\'s voice broke and he turned away for a moment so that his\\r\\nvisitor should not see his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well!\" he continued. \"You\\'ve got Pete right this time--no doubt of\\r\\nthat. I dunno what makes him such a mean whelp. I\\'ll lambaste him good\\r\\nfor this, now I tell you. But the stacks----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make him pay for them out of his own money. Mrs. Atterson ought not to\\r\\nlose the stacks,\" said Hiram, slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, he\\'ll do that, anyway, you can bet!\" exclaimed Dickerson, with\\r\\nconviction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe that sending a boy like him to jail will either improve\\r\\nhis morals, or do anybody else any good,\" observed Hiram, reflectively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it\\'ll jest about finish his mother,\" spoke Sam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, too,\" said the young farmer. \"I tell you. I don\\'t want\\r\\nto see him--not just now. But you do what you think is best about this\\r\\nmatter, and make Peter pay the bill--ten dollars for the two stacks of\\r\\nfodder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He shall do it, Mr. Strong,\" declared Sam Dickerson, warmly. \"And he\\r\\nshall beg your pardon, too, or I\\'ll larrup him until he can\\'t stand.\\r\\nHe\\'s too big for a lickin\\', but he ain\\'t too big for me to lick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the elder Dickerson was as good as his word. An hour later yells\\r\\nfrom the cart shed denoted that Pete was finally getting what he should\\r\\nhave received when he was a younger boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore noon Sam marched the youth over to Mrs. Atterson. Pete was very\\r\\npuffy about the eyes, and his cheeks were streaked with tears. Nor did\\r\\nhe seem to care to more than sit upon the extreme edge of a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he paid Mrs. Atterson ten dollars, and then, nudged by his father,\\r\\nturned to Hiram and begged the young farmer\\'s pardon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all right, etc.,\" said Hiram, laying his hand upon the boy\\'s\\r\\nshoulder. \"Just because we haven\\'t got on well together heretofore,\\r\\nneedn\\'t make any difference between us after this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come over and see me. If you have time this summer and want the work,\\r\\nI\\'ll be glad to hire you to help handle my celery crop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neighbors ought to be neighborly; and it won\\'t do either of us any good\\r\\nto hug to ourselves any injury which we fancy the other has done. We\\'ll\\r\\nbe friends if you say so, Peter--though I tell you right now that if you\\r\\nturn another mean trick against me, I\\'ll take the law into my own hands\\r\\nand give you worse than you\\'ve got already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPete looked sheepish enough, and shook hands. He knew very well that\\r\\nHiram could do as he promised.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut from that time on the young farmer had no further trouble with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Hiram\\'s crops on the Atterson Eighty grew almost as well this\\r\\nsecond season as they had the first. There was a bad drouth this year,\\r\\nand the upland corn did not do so well; yet the young farmer\\'s corn crop\\r\\ncompared well with the crops in the neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had put in but eight acres of corn this year; but they had plenty of\\r\\nold corn in the crib when it came time to take down this second season\\'s\\r\\ncrop.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was upon the celery that Hiram bent all his energies. He had to pay\\r\\nout considerable for help, but that was no more than he expected. Celery\\r\\ntakes a deal of handling.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the long, hot, dry days came, when the uplands parched and the\\r\\nearth fairly seemed to radiate the heat, the acres of tender plants\\r\\nwhich Hiram and his helpers had just set out in the trenches began to\\r\\nwilt most discouragingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Pollock, who did all he could to aid Hiram on the crop, shook his\\r\\nhead in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a-layin\\' down on you, Hiram--it\\'s a-layin\\' down on you. Another\\r\\nday like this and your celery crop will be pretty small pertaters!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that would be a transformation worthy of the attention of all\\r\\nthe agricultural schools, Henry,\" returned the young farmer, grimly\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You got a heart--to laugh at your own loss,\" said Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There isn\\'t any loss--yet,\" declared Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there\\'s bound to be,\" said his friend, a regular \"Job\\'s comforter\"\\r\\nfor the nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, Henry; you\\'d have me give up too easy. \\'Never say die!\\'\\r\\nThat\\'s the farmer\\'s motto.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jinks!\" exclaimed young Pollock, \"they\\'re dying all around us just the\\r\\nsame--and their crops, too. We ain\\'t going to have half a corn crop if\\r\\nthis spell of dry weather keeps on. And the papers don\\'t give us a sign\\r\\nof hope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When there doesn\\'t seem to be a sign of hope is when the really\\r\\nup-to-date farmer begins to actually work,\" chuckled Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And just tell me what you\\'re going to do for this field of wilted\\r\\ncelery?\" demanded Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on up to the house and I\\'ll get Mother Atterson to give us an\\r\\nearly supper,\" quoth Hiram. \"I\\'m going to town and I invite you to go\\r\\nwith me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry had got used by this time to Hiram\\'s little mysteries. But this\\r\\nseemed to him a case where man had done all that could be done for the\\r\\ncrop, and without Providential interposition, \"the whole field would\\r\\nhave to go to pot\", as he expressed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in his heart the young farmer knew that the outlook for a paying\\r\\ncrop of celery right then was very small indeed. He had done his best\\r\\nin preparing the soil, in enriching it, in raising the sets and\\r\\ntransplanting them--up to this point he had brought his big commercial\\r\\ncrop, at considerable expense. If the drouth really \"got\" it, he would\\r\\nhave, at the most, but a poor and stunted crop to ship in the Fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Hiram Strong was not the fellow to throw up his hands and own\\r\\nhimself beaten at such a time as this. Here was an obstacle that must\\r\\nbe overcome. The harder the problem looked the more determined he was to\\r\\nsolve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two boys drove to town that evening and Hiram sought out a man who\\r\\ncontracted to move houses, clean cisterns and wells, and various work\\r\\nof that kind. He knew this man had just the thing he needed, and after\\r\\na conference with him, Hiram loaded some bulky paraphernalia into the\\r\\nlight wagon--it was so dark Henry could not see what it was--and they\\r\\ndrove home again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d like to know what the Jim Hickey you\\'re about, Hiram,\" sniffed\\r\\nHenry, in disgust. \"What\\'s all this litter back here in the wagon?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You come over and give me a hand in the morning--early now, say by\\r\\nsun-up--and you\\'ll find out. I want a couple of husky chaps like you,\"\\r\\nchuckled Hiram. \"I\\'ll get Pete Dickerson to work against me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you do, you tell Pete he\\'ll have to work lively,\" said Henry, with\\r\\na grin. \"I don\\'t know what it is you want us to do, but I reckon I can\\r\\nkeep my end up with Pete, from hoein\\' \\'taters to cuttin\\' cord-wood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can keep your end up with him, can you?\" chuckled Hiram. \"Well! I\\r\\nbet you can\\'t in this game I\\'m going to put you two fellows up against.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! Pete Dickerson beat me at anything--unless it\\'s sleeping?\"\\r\\ngrunted Henry, with vast disgust. \"I\\'ll keep my end up with him at\\r\\nanything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the more assured he was of this the more Hiram was amused. \"Come\\r\\non over early, Henry,\" said the young farmer, \"and I\\'ll show you that\\r\\nthere\\'s at least one thing in which you can\\'t keep your end up with\\r\\nPete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis friend was almost angry when he started off across the fields for\\r\\nhome; but he was mighty curious, too. That curiosity, if nothing\\r\\nmore, would have brought him to the Atterson house in good season the\\r\\nfollowing morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready, however, Hiram and Pete--with the light wagon--had gone down\\r\\nto the riverside. Henry hurried after them and reached the celery field\\r\\njust as the red face of the sun appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been little dew during the night and the tender transplants\\r\\nhad scarcely lifted their heads. Indeed, the last acre set out the day\\r\\nbefore were flat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the bank of the river, and near that suffering acre, were Hiram and\\r\\nPete Dickerson. Henry hurried to them, wondering at the thing he saw\\r\\nupon the bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram was already laying out between the celery rows a long hosepipe.\\r\\nThis was attached to a good-sized force-pump, the feedpipe of which was\\r\\nin the river. It was a two-man pump and was worked by an up-and-down\\r\\n\"brake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Catch hold here, Henry,\" laughed Hiram. \"One of you on each side now,\\r\\nand pump for all you\\'re worth. And see if I\\'m not right, my boy. You\\r\\ncan\\'t keep your end up with Pete at this job; for if you do, the water\\r\\nwon\\'t flow!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry admitted that he had, been badly sold by the joke; but he was\\r\\nenthusiastic in his praise of Hiram\\'s ingenuity, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aw, say!\" said the young farmer, \"what do you suppose the Good Lord\\r\\ngave us brains for? Just so as to keep our fingers out of the fire? No,\\r\\nsir! With all this perfectly good and wet water running past my field,\\r\\ncould I have the heart to let this celery die? I guess not!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had a fine spray nozzle on the pipe and the pipe itself was long\\r\\nenough so that, by moving the pump occasionally, he could water every\\r\\nsquare foot of the big piece. And the three young fellows, by changing\\r\\nabout, went over the field every other day in about four hours without\\r\\ndifficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by the celery plants got rooted well; they no longer drooped in\\r\\nthe morning; before the drouth was past the young farmer had as handsome\\r\\na field of celery as one would wish. Indeed, when he began to ship the\\r\\ncrop, even his earliest crates were rated A-1 by the produce men, and he\\r\\nbad no difficulty in selling the entire crop at the top of the market,\\r\\nright through the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe garden paid a profit; the potatoes did even better than the year\\r\\nbefore, and Hiram harvested and sold seventy-five dollars\\' worth while\\r\\nthe price for new potatoes was high.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shipped most of his tomatoes this year, for he could not pay\\r\\nattention to the local market as he had the first season; but the tomato\\r\\ncrop was a good one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey raised to eight weeks and sold, during the year, five pair of\\r\\nshoats, and Mrs. Atterson bought a grade cow with her calf by her side,\\r\\nfor a hundred dollars, and made ten pounds of butter a week right\\r\\nthrough the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Lem Camp, looking ten years younger than when he came to the farm,\\r\\nmuscular and brown, did all the work about the barns now, milked the\\r\\ncows, and relieved Hiram of all the chores.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, with some little help about the plowing and cultivating, Hiram\\r\\nknew very well that Mrs. Atterson and Old Lem could run the farm another\\r\\nyear without his help.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the old lady could not expect to put in any crop that would\\r\\npay her like the celery; for when they footed up their books, the\\r\\nbottom-land had yielded, as Hiram had once prophesied to Mr. Bronson\\r\\nover four hundred dollars the acre, net.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-four hundred dollars income from six acres; and the profit was\\r\\nmore than fifty per cent. Indeed, Hiram\\'s share of the profit amounted\\r\\nto three hundred and seventy dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his hundred dollar wage, and the money he had saved the previous\\r\\nseason, when the crops were harvested this second season, the young\\r\\nfarmer\\'s bank book showed a balance of over five hundred dollars to his\\r\\ncredit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m eighteen years old and over,\" soliloquized the young farmer. \"And\\r\\nI\\'ve got a capital of five hundred dollars. Can\\'t I turn that capital\\r\\nsome way go as to give me a bigger--a broader--chance?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thus far I\\'ve been a one-horse farmer; I want to be something better\\r\\nthan that. Now, there\\'s no use in my hanging around here, waiting for\\r\\nsomething to turn up. I must get a move on me and turn something up for\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXV. LOOKING AHEAD\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this year Hiram had not seen much of Mr. Bronson, or Lettie. They\\r\\nhad gone back to the West over the summer vacation, and when Lettie\\r\\nhad returned for her last year at St. Beris, her father had not come on\\r\\nuntil near Thanksgiving.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram had spoken with Lettie several times during the fail, and he\\r\\nthought that she had vastly improved in one way, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not be any prettier, it seemed to him; but her manner was more\\r\\ncordial, and she always asked after Sister and Mrs. Atterson, and showed\\r\\nthat her interest in him was not a mere surface interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, when Hiram had been shipping some of the last of his celery,\\r\\nLettie met him on the street near the Scoville railroad station. Hiram\\r\\nwas in his high boots, and overalls; and Lettie was with two of her girl\\r\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the girl stopped him and shook hands, and told him that her father\\r\\nhad arrived and wanted to see him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We want you to come to dinner Saturday evening, Hiram. Father insists,\\r\\nand I shall be very much disappointed if you do not come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, that\\'s very kind of you, Miss Lettie,\" responded the young farmer,\\r\\nslowly, trying to find some good reason for refusing the invitation. He\\r\\nwas determined not to be patronized.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Hiram! This is very important. We want you to meet somebody,\" said\\r\\nLettie, her eyes dancing. \"Somebody very particular. Now! do say you\\'ll\\r\\ncome like a good boy, and not keep me teasing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll come, Miss Lettie,\" he finally agreed, and she gave him a\\r\\nmost charming smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nLettie\\'s two friends had waited for her, very much amused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I declare, Let!\" cried one of them--and her voice reached Hiram\\'s ears\\r\\nquite plainly. \"You do have the queerest friends. Why did you stop to\\r\\nspeak to that yokel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush! he\\'ll hear you,\" said Miss Bronson; yet she smiled, too. \"So you\\r\\nthink Hiram is a yokel, do you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hiram!\" repeated her friend. \"Goodness me! I should think the name was\\r\\nenough. And those boots--and overalls!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Lettie, still amused, \"I\\'ve seen my own father in just such\\r\\na costume. And you know very well that he is a pretty good looking man,\\r\\ndressed up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Let! your father\\'s never a farmer$\" gasped the other girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, she\\'s just joking us,\" laughed the third girl. \"Of course he\\'s a\\r\\nfarmer--he owns half a dozen farms. But he\\'s the kind of a farmer who\\r\\nrides around in his automobile and looks over his crops.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and this young man may do that--in time,\" said Lettie. \"At least,\\r\\nmy father believes Hi is aimed that way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He doesn\\'t look as though he had a cent,\" said the third girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is putting away more money of his very own in the bank than any boy\\r\\nwe know, who works. Father says so,\" declared Lettie. \"He says Hi has\\r\\ndone wonderfully well with his crops this year--and he is only raising\\r\\nthem on shares.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me tell you, girls, the farmer is coming into his own, these\\r\\ndays. That is a great saying of father\\'s. He believes that the man\\r\\nwho produces the food-stuffs for the rest of the world should have a\\r\\nsatisfactory share of the proceeds of their sale. And that is coming,\\r\\nfather says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Farmers don\\'t have to half starve, and be burdened by mortgages and\\r\\nignorance, any longer. The country sections are waking up. With good\\r\\nschools and good roads, and the grange, and all, many rural districts\\r\\nare already ahead of the cities in the things worth while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen to Let lecture!\" sniffed one of her friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right. You wait. Maybe you\\'ll see that same young fellow--Hi\\r\\nStrong--come through this town in his own auto before you graduate from\\r\\nSt. Beris.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pshaw!\" exclaimed the other. \"If I do I\\'ll ask him for a ride,\" and the\\r\\ndiscussion ended in a laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps, however, had Hiram heard all Lettie had said he would not have\\r\\nbeen so doubtful in regard to fulfilling his promise about taking dinner\\r\\nwith Mr. Bronson and his daughter on Saturday evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo tell the truth, the more he thought of it, the more he shrank from\\r\\nthe ordeal. Once he had hoped Mr. Bronson would be the one to show him\\r\\nthe way out of the backwater of Crawberry. Hiram had not forgotten how\\r\\nterribly disappointed he had been when he could not find the gentleman\\'s\\r\\ncard in the sewer excavation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd later, when Mr. Bronson had suggested that he leave Mrs. Atterson\\r\\nand come to him to work, Hiram feared that he had missed an opportunity\\r\\nthat would never be offered him again. His contract was practically\\r\\nover with his present employer, and Hiram\\'s ambition urged him to desire\\r\\ngreater things in the farming line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt might be in Mr. Bronson\\'s power to aid the young farmer right along\\r\\nthis line. The gentleman owned farms in the Middle West that were being\\r\\ntilled on up-to-date methods, and by modern machinery. Hiram desired\\r\\nvery strongly to get upon a place of that character. He wished to learn\\r\\nhow to handle tools and machinery which it would never pay a \"one-horse\\r\\nfarmer\" to own. But how deeply had the gentleman been offended\\r\\nby Hiram\\'s refusal to come to work for him when he gave him that\\r\\nopportunity? That was a question that bit deep into the young farmer\\'s\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he went to the Bronson\\'s house on Saturday, in good season, Mr.\\r\\nBronson met him cordially, in the library.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my boy, they all tell me you have done it!\" exclaimed the\\r\\nWesterner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Done what?\" queried Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Made the most money per acre for Mrs. Atterson that this county ever\\r\\nsaw. Is that right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve succeeded in what I set out to do,\" said Hiram, modestly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I did not believe myself that you could do it,\" declared the\\r\\ngentleman. \"And it\\'s too bad, too, that I was a Doubting Thomas,\" added\\r\\nMr. Bronson, his eyes beginning to dance a good deal like Lettie\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, Hiram, I had it in my mind when I took this place to get a\\r\\nyoung men from around here and teach him something of my ways of work,\\r\\nand finally take him back West with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have several farms that are paying me good incomes; but good\\r\\nfarm-managers are hard to get. I wanted to train one--a young man. I\\r\\nran against a promising lad before you came to the Atterson place; but I\\r\\nlost track of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you been willing to leave Mrs. Atterson and come to me,\" continued\\r\\nMr. Bronson, \"I believe I could have licked you into shape last season\\r\\nso that you would have suited me very well,\" and he laughed outright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But now I want you to meet my future farm-manager. He is the very\\r\\nfellow I wanted before I offered the chance to you. I reckon you\\'ll be\\r\\nglad to see him----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was talking, Mr. Bronson had put his hand on Hiram\\'s shoulder,\\r\\nand urged him down the length of the room. They had come to a heavy\\r\\nportiere; Hiram thought it masked a doorway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is the fellow himself,\" exclaimed Bronson suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe curtain was whisked away. Hiram heard Lettie giggling somewhere\\r\\nin the folds of it. And he found himself staring straight into a long\\r\\nmirror which reflected both himself and the laughing Mr. Bronson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hiram Strong!\" spoke the Westerner, admonishingly, \"why didn\\'t you tell\\r\\nme long ago that you were the lad who turned my horses out of the ditch\\r\\nthat evening back in Crawberry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why--why----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His fatal modesty,\" laughed Lettie, appearing and clapping her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess it wasn\\'t that,\" said Hiram, slowly. \"What was the use? I would\\r\\nhave been glad of your assistance at the time; but when I found you I\\r\\nhad already made a contract with Mrs. Atterson, and--what was the use?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, perhaps it would have made no difference. When I had dug up the\\r\\nfact that you were the same fellow whom I had looked for at Dwight\\'s\\r\\nEmporium, it struck me that possibly the character that old scoundrel\\r\\ngave you had some basis in fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I said nothing to you after you had refused to break your contract.\\r\\nThat, Hiram, was a good point in your favor. And what that little girl\\r\\nat your house has told Lettie about you--and the way Mrs. Atterson\\r\\nspeaks of you, and all--long since convinced me that you were just the\\r\\nlad I wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Hiram, I believe you know a good deal about farming that I don\\'t\\r\\nknow myself. And, at any rate, if you can do what you have done with a\\r\\nrun-down place like the Atterson Eighty, I\\'d like to see what you can do\\r\\nwith a bigger and better farm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you say? Will you come to me--if only for a year? I\\'ll make it\\r\\nworth your while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that Hiram Strong did not let this opportunity slip past him will be\\r\\nshown in the next volume of this series, entitled: \"Hiram in the Middle\\r\\nWest; Or, A Young Farmer\\'s Upward Struggle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sorry to leave Mrs. Atterson at Christmas time; but the old lady\\r\\nsaw that it was to Hiram\\'s advantage to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And good land o\\' Goshen, Hiram! I wouldn\\'t stand in no boy\\'s way--not\\r\\na boy like you, leastways. You\\'ve always been square with me, and you\\'ve\\r\\ngiven me a new lease of life. For I never would have dared to give up\\r\\nthe boarding house and come to the farm if it hadn\\'t been for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is your home--jest as much as it is Sister\\'s home, and Old Lem\\r\\nCamp\\'s. Don\\'t forgit that, Hiram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll find us all here whenever you want to come back to it. For I\\'ve\\r\\ntalked with Mr. Strickland and I\\'m going to adopt Sister, all reg\\'lar,\\r\\nand she shall have what I leave when I die, only promising to give Mr.\\r\\nCamp a shelter, if he should outlast me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sister\\'s folks may never look her up, and she may never git that money\\r\\nthe institution folk think is coming to her. But she\\'ll be well fixed\\r\\nhere, that\\'s sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, taking it all around, everybody of importance to the story\\r\\nseemed to be \"well fixed\", as Mother Atterson expressed it. She herself\\r\\nneed never be disturbed by the vagaries of boarders, or troubled in her\\r\\nmind, either waking or sleeping, about the gravy--save on Thanksgiving\\r\\nDay.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Lem Camp and Sister were provided for by their own exertions and\\r\\nMrs. Atterson\\'s kindness. The Dickersons--even Pete--had become friendly\\r\\nneighbors. Henry Pollock had waked up his father, and they were running\\r\\nthe Pollock farm on much more modern lines than before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Hiram himself was looking ahead to a scheme of life that suited him,\\r\\nand to a chance \"to make good\" on a much larger scale than he had on the\\r\\nAtterson Eighty where, nevertheless, he had made the soil pay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Hiram The Young Farmer, by Burbank L.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"

The threatening\\r\\nwalls of this tumbledown abode seemed to have been decorated with\\r\\nhieroglyphics. For what other name could the passer-by give to the Xs\\r\\nand Vs which the horizontal or diagonal timbers traced on the front,\\r\\noutlined by little parallel cracks in the plaster? It was evident that\\r\\nevery beam quivered in its mortices at the passing of the lightest\\r\\nvehicle. This venerable structure was crowned by a triangular roof of\\r\\nwhich no example will, ere long, be seen in Paris. This covering, warped\\r\\nby the extremes of the Paris climate, projected three feet over the\\r\\nroadway, as much to protect the threshold from the rainfall as to\\r\\nshelter the wall of a loft and its sill-less dormer-window. This upper\\r\\nstory was built of planks, overlapping each other like slates, in order,\\r\\nno doubt, not to overweight the frail house.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne rainy morning in the month of March, a young man, carefully wrapped\\r\\nin his cloak, stood under the awning of a shop opposite this old house,\\r\\nwhich he was studying with the enthusiasm of an antiquary. In point of\\r\\nfact, this relic of the civic life of the sixteenth century offered\\r\\nmore than one problem to the consideration of an observer. Each story\\r\\npresented some singularity; on the first floor four tall, narrow\\r\\nwindows, close together, were filled as to the lower panes with boards,\\r\\nso as to produce the doubtful light by which a clever salesman can\\r\\nascribe to his goods the color his customers inquire for. The young man\\r\\nseemed very scornful of this part of the house; his eyes had not yet\\r\\nrested on it. The windows of the second floor, where the Venetian blinds\\r\\nwere drawn up, revealing little dingy muslin curtains behind the large\\r\\nBohemian glass panes, did not interest him either. His attention was\\r\\nattracted to the third floor, to the modest sash-frames of wood, so\\r\\nclumsily wrought that they might have found a place in the Museum of\\r\\nArts and Crafts to illustrate the early efforts of French carpentry.\\r\\nThese windows were glazed with small squares of glass so green that, but\\r\\nfor his good eyes, the young man could not have seen the blue-checked\\r\\ncotton curtains which screened the mysteries of the room from profane\\r\\neyes. Now and then the watcher, weary of his fruitless contemplation,\\r\\nor of the silence in which the house was buried, like the whole\\r\\nneighborhood, dropped his eyes towards the lower regions. An involuntary\\r\\nsmile parted his lips each time he looked at the shop, where, in fact,\\r\\nthere were some laughable details.\\r\\n\\r\\nA formidable wooden beam, resting on four pillars, which appeared to\\r\\nhave bent under the weight of the decrepit house, had been encrusted\\r\\nwith as many coats of different paint as there are of rouge on an old\\r\\nduchess\\' cheek. In the middle of this broad and fantastically carved\\r\\njoist there was an old painting representing a cat playing rackets. This\\r\\npicture was what moved the young man to mirth. But it must be said\\r\\nthat the wittiest of modern painters could not invent so comical a\\r\\ncaricature. The animal held in one of its forepaws a racket as big as\\r\\nitself, and stood on its hind legs to aim at hitting an enormous ball,\\r\\nreturned by a man in a fine embroidered coat. Drawing, color, and\\r\\naccessories, all were treated in such a way as to suggest that the\\r\\nartist had meant to make game of the shop-owner and of the passing\\r\\nobserver. Time, while impairing this artless painting, had made it yet\\r\\nmore grotesque by introducing some uncertain features which must have\\r\\npuzzled the conscientious idler. For instance, the cat\\'s tail had been\\r\\neaten into in such a way that it might now have been taken for the\\r\\nfigure of a spectator--so long, and thick, and furry were the tails of\\r\\nour forefathers\\' cats. To the right of the picture, on an azure field\\r\\nwhich ill-disguised the decay of the wood, might be read the name\\r\\n\"Guillaume,\" and to the left, \"Successor to Master Chevrel.\" Sun and\\r\\nrain had worn away most of the gilding parsimoniously applied to the\\r\\nletters of this superscription, in which the Us and Vs had changed\\r\\nplaces in obedience to the laws of old-world orthography.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo quench the pride of those who believe that the world is growing\\r\\ncleverer day by day, and that modern humbug surpasses everything, it may\\r\\nbe observed that these signs, of which the origin seems so whimsical to\\r\\nmany Paris merchants, are the dead pictures of once living pictures\\r\\nby which our roguish ancestors contrived to tempt customers into their\\r\\nhouses. Thus the Spinning Sow, the Green Monkey, and others, were\\r\\nanimals in cages whose skills astonished the passer-by, and whose\\r\\naccomplishments prove the patience of the fifteenth-century artisan.\\r\\nSuch curiosities did more to enrich their fortunate owners than the\\r\\nsigns of \"Providence,\" \"Good-faith,\" \"Grace of God,\" and \"Decapitation\\r\\nof John the Baptist,\" which may still be seen in the Rue Saint-Denis.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, our stranger was certainly not standing there to admire the\\r\\ncat, which a minute\\'s attention sufficed to stamp on his memory. The\\r\\nyoung man himself had his peculiarities. His cloak, folded after the\\r\\nmanner of an antique drapery, showed a smart pair of shoes, all the more\\r\\nremarkable in the midst of the Paris mud, because he wore white silk\\r\\nstockings, on which the splashes betrayed his impatience. He had just\\r\\ncome, no doubt, from a wedding or a ball; for at this early hour he had\\r\\nin his hand a pair of white gloves, and his black hair, now out of curl,\\r\\nand flowing over his shoulders, showed that it had been dressed _a la\\r\\nCaracalla_, a fashion introduced as much by David\\'s school of painting\\r\\nas by the mania for Greek and Roman styles which characterized the early\\r\\nyears of this century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the noise made by a few market gardeners, who, being late,\\r\\nrattled past towards the great market-place at a gallop, the busy street\\r\\nlay in a stillness of which the magic charm is known only to those who\\r\\nhave wandered through deserted Paris at the hours when its roar, hushed\\r\\nfor a moment, rises and spreads in the distance like the great voice\\r\\nof the sea. This strange young man must have seemed as curious to the\\r\\nshopkeeping folk of the \"Cat and Racket\" as the \"Cat and Racket\" was\\r\\nto him. A dazzlingly white cravat made his anxious face look even paler\\r\\nthan it really was. The fire that flashed in his black eyes, gloomy\\r\\nand sparkling by turns, was in harmony with the singular outline of\\r\\nhis features, with his wide, flexible mouth, hardened into a smile. His\\r\\nforehead, knit with violent annoyance, had a stamp of doom. Is not the\\r\\nforehead the most prophetic feature of a man? When the stranger\\'s\\r\\nbrow expressed passion the furrows formed in it were terrible in their\\r\\nstrength and energy; but when he recovered his calmness, so easily\\r\\nupset, it beamed with a luminous grace which gave great attractiveness\\r\\nto a countenance in which joy, grief, love, anger, or scorn blazed out\\r\\nso contagiously that the coldest man could not fail to be impressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was so thoroughly vexed by the time when the dormer-window of the\\r\\nloft was suddenly flung open, that he did not observe the apparition of\\r\\nthree laughing faces, pink and white and chubby, but as vulgar as the\\r\\nface of Commerce as it is seen in sculpture on certain monuments. These\\r\\nthree faces, framed by the window, recalled the puffy cherubs floating\\r\\namong the clouds that surround God the Father. The apprentices snuffed\\r\\nup the exhalations of the street with an eagerness that showed how hot\\r\\nand poisonous the atmosphere of their garret must be. After pointing to\\r\\nthe singular sentinel, the most jovial, as he seemed, of the apprentices\\r\\nretired and came back holding an instrument whose hard metal pipe is now\\r\\nsuperseded by a leather tube; and they all grinned with mischief as they\\r\\nlooked down on the loiterer, and sprinkled him with a fine white\\r\\nshower of which the scent proved that three chins had just been shaved.\\r\\nStanding on tiptoe, in the farthest corner of their loft, to enjoy\\r\\ntheir victim\\'s rage, the lads ceased laughing on seeing the haughty\\r\\nindifference with which the young man shook his cloak, and the\\r\\nintense contempt expressed by his face as he glanced up at the empty\\r\\nwindow-frame.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment a slender white hand threw up the lower half of one of\\r\\nthe clumsy windows on the third floor by the aid of the sash runners,\\r\\nof which the pulley so often suddenly gives way and releases the heavy\\r\\npanes it ought to hold up. The watcher was then rewarded for his long\\r\\nwaiting. The face of a young girl appeared, as fresh as one of the\\r\\nwhite cups that bloom on the bosom of the waters, crowned by a frill\\r\\nof tumbled muslin, which gave her head a look of exquisite innocence.\\r\\nThough wrapped in brown stuff, her neck and shoulders gleamed here\\r\\nand there through little openings left by her movements in sleep. No\\r\\nexpression of embarrassment detracted from the candor of her face, or\\r\\nthe calm look of eyes immortalized long since in the sublime works of\\r\\nRaphael; here were the same grace, the same repose as in those Virgins,\\r\\nand now proverbial. There was a delightful contrast between the cheeks\\r\\nof that face on which sleep had, as it were, given high relief to a\\r\\nsuperabundance of life, and the antiquity of the heavy window with its\\r\\nclumsy shape and black sill. Like those day-blowing flowers, which\\r\\nin the early morning have not yet unfurled their cups, twisted by the\\r\\nchills of night, the girl, as yet hardly awake, let her blue eyes wander\\r\\nbeyond the neighboring roofs to look at the sky; then, from habit,\\r\\nshe cast them down on the gloomy depths of the street, where they\\r\\nimmediately met those of her adorer. Vanity, no doubt, distressed her at\\r\\nbeing seen in undress; she started back, the worn pulley gave way, and\\r\\nthe sash fell with the rapid run, which in our day has earned for this\\r\\nartless invention of our forefathers an odious name, _Fenetre a la\\r\\nGuillotine_. The vision had disappeared. To the young man the most\\r\\nradiant star of morning seemed to be hidden by a cloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these little incidents the heavy inside shutters that protected\\r\\nthe slight windows of the shop of the \"Cat and Racket\" had been removed\\r\\nas if by magic. The old door with its knocker was opened back against\\r\\nthe wall of the entry by a man-servant, apparently coeval with the sign,\\r\\nwho, with a shaking hand, hung upon it a square of cloth, on which were\\r\\nembroidered in yellow silk the words: \"Guillaume, successor to Chevrel.\"\\r\\nMany a passer-by would have found it difficult to guess the class of\\r\\ntrade carried on by Monsieur Guillaume. Between the strong iron bars\\r\\nwhich protected his shop windows on the outside, certain packages,\\r\\nwrapped in brown linen, were hardly visible, though as numerous as\\r\\nherrings swimming in a shoal. Notwithstanding the primitive aspect of\\r\\nthe Gothic front, Monsieur Guillaume, of all the merchant clothiers in\\r\\nParis, was the one whose stores were always the best provided, whose\\r\\nconnections were the most extensive, and whose commercial honesty never\\r\\nlay under the slightest suspicion. If some of his brethren in business\\r\\nmade a contract with the Government, and had not the required quantity\\r\\nof cloth, he was always ready to deliver it, however large the number of\\r\\npieces tendered for. The wily dealer knew a thousand ways of extracting\\r\\nthe largest profits without being obliged, like them, to court\\r\\npatrons, cringing to them, or making them costly presents. When his\\r\\nfellow-tradesmen could only pay in good bills of long date, he would\\r\\nmention his notary as an accommodating man, and managed to get a second\\r\\nprofit out of the bargain, thanks to this arrangement, which had made it\\r\\na proverb among the traders of the Rue Saint-Denis: \"Heaven preserve you\\r\\nfrom Monsieur Guillaume\\'s notary!\" to signify a heavy discount.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old merchant was to be seen standing on the threshold of his shop,\\r\\nas if by a miracle, the instant the servant withdrew. Monsieur Guillaume\\r\\nlooked at the Rue Saint-Denis, at the neighboring shops, and at the\\r\\nweather, like a man disembarking at Havre, and seeing France once more\\r\\nafter a long voyage. Having convinced himself that nothing had changed\\r\\nwhile he was asleep, he presently perceived the stranger on guard, and\\r\\nhe, on his part, gazed at the patriarchal draper as Humboldt may have\\r\\nscrutinized the first electric eel he saw in America. Monsieur Guillaume\\r\\nwore loose black velvet breeches, pepper-and-salt stockings, and square\\r\\ntoed shoes with silver buckles. His coat, with square-cut fronts,\\r\\nsquare-cut tails, and square-cut collar clothed his slightly bent figure\\r\\nin greenish cloth, finished with white metal buttons, tawny from wear.\\r\\nHis gray hair was so accurately combed and flattened over his yellow\\r\\npate that it made it look like a furrowed field. His little green eyes,\\r\\nthat might have been pierced with a gimlet, flashed beneath arches\\r\\nfaintly tinged with red in the place of eyebrows. Anxieties had wrinkled\\r\\nhis forehead with as many horizontal lines as there were creases in his\\r\\ncoat. This colorless face expressed patience, commercial shrewdness,\\r\\nand the sort of wily cupidity which is needful in business. At that\\r\\ntime these old families were less rare than they are now, in which the\\r\\ncharacteristic habits and costume of their calling, surviving in\\r\\nthe midst of more recent civilization, were preserved as cherished\\r\\ntraditions, like the antediluvian remains found by Cuvier in the\\r\\nquarries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head of the Guillaume family was a notable upholder of ancient\\r\\npractices; he might be heard to regret the Provost of Merchants, and\\r\\nnever did he mention a decision of the Tribunal of Commerce without\\r\\ncalling it the _Sentence of the Consuls_. Up and dressed the first of\\r\\nthe household, in obedience, no doubt, to these old customs, he stood\\r\\nsternly awaiting the appearance of his three assistants, ready to scold\\r\\nthem in case they were late. These young disciples of Mercury knew\\r\\nnothing more terrible than the wordless assiduity with which the master\\r\\nscrutinized their faces and their movements on Monday in search of\\r\\nevidence or traces of their pranks. But at this moment the old clothier\\r\\npaid no heed to his apprentices; he was absorbed in trying to divine the\\r\\nmotive of the anxious looks which the young man in silk stockings and a\\r\\ncloak cast alternately at his signboard and into the depths of his shop.\\r\\nThe daylight was now brighter, and enabled the stranger to discern the\\r\\ncashier\\'s corner enclosed by a railing and screened by old green silk\\r\\ncurtains, where were kept the immense ledgers, the silent oracles of the\\r\\nhouse. The too inquisitive gazer seemed to covet this little nook,\\r\\nand to be taking the plan of a dining-room at one side, lighted by\\r\\na skylight, whence the family at meals could easily see the smallest\\r\\nincident that might occur at the shop-door. So much affection for his\\r\\ndwelling seemed suspicious to a trader who had lived long enough to\\r\\nremember the law of maximum prices; Monsieur Guillaume naturally thought\\r\\nthat this sinister personage had an eye to the till of the Cat and\\r\\nRacket. After quietly observing the mute duel which was going on between\\r\\nhis master and the stranger, the eldest of the apprentices, having seen\\r\\nthat the young man was stealthily watching the windows of the third\\r\\nfloor, ventured to place himself on the stone flag where Monsieur\\r\\nGuillaume was standing. He took two steps out into the street, raised\\r\\nhis head, and fancied that he caught sight of Mademoiselle Augustine\\r\\nGuillaume in hasty retreat. The draper, annoyed by his assistant\\'s\\r\\nperspicacity, shot a side glance at him; but the draper and his amorous\\r\\napprentice were suddenly relieved from the fears which the young man\\'s\\r\\npresence had excited in their minds. He hailed a hackney cab on its\\r\\nway to a neighboring stand, and jumped into it with an air of affected\\r\\nindifference. This departure was a balm to the hearts of the other two\\r\\nlads, who had been somewhat uneasy as to meeting the victim of their\\r\\npractical joke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, gentlemen, what ails you that you are standing there with your\\r\\narms folded?\" said Monsieur Guillaume to his three neophytes. \"In former\\r\\ndays, bless you, when I was in Master Chevrel\\'s service, I should have\\r\\noverhauled more than two pieces of cloth by this time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it was daylight earlier,\" said the second assistant, whose duty\\r\\nthis was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old shopkeeper could not help smiling. Though two of these\\r\\nyoung fellows, who were confided to his care by their fathers, rich\\r\\nmanufacturers at Louviers and at Sedan, had only to ask and to have a\\r\\nhundred thousand francs the day when they were old enough to settle in\\r\\nlife, Guillaume regarded it as his duty to keep them under the rod of an\\r\\nold-world despotism, unknown nowadays in the showy modern shops, where\\r\\nthe apprentices expect to be rich men at thirty. He made them work like\\r\\nNegroes. These three assistants were equal to a business which would\\r\\nharry ten such clerks as those whose sybaritical tastes now swell the\\r\\ncolumns of the budget. Not a sound disturbed the peace of this solemn\\r\\nhouse, where the hinges were always oiled, and where the meanest article\\r\\nof furniture showed the respectable cleanliness which reveals strict\\r\\norder and economy. The most waggish of the three youths often amused\\r\\nhimself by writing the date of its first appearance on the Gruyere\\r\\ncheese which was left to their tender mercies at breakfast, and which it\\r\\nwas their pleasure to leave untouched. This bit of mischief, and a few\\r\\nothers of the same stamp, would sometimes bring a smile on the face of\\r\\nthe younger of Guillaume\\'s daughters, the pretty maiden who has just now\\r\\nappeared to the bewitched man in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough each of these apprentices, even the eldest, paid a round sum for\\r\\nhis board, not one of them would have been bold enough to remain at the\\r\\nmaster\\'s table when dessert was served. When Madame Guillaume talked of\\r\\ndressing the salad, the hapless youths trembled as they thought of the\\r\\nthrift with which her prudent hand dispensed the oil. They could never\\r\\nthink of spending a night away from the house without having given, long\\r\\nbefore, a plausible reason for such an irregularity. Every Sunday, each\\r\\nin his turn, two of them accompanied the Guillaume family to Mass at\\r\\nSaint-Leu, and to vespers. Mesdemoiselles Virginie and Augustine, simply\\r\\nattired in cotton print, each took the arm of an apprentice and walked\\r\\nin front, under the piercing eye of their mother, who closed the little\\r\\nfamily procession with her husband, accustomed by her to carry two large\\r\\nprayer-books, bound in black morocco. The second apprentice received\\r\\nno salary. As for the eldest, whose twelve years of perseverance and\\r\\ndiscretion had initiated him into the secrets of the house, he was paid\\r\\neight hundred francs a year as the reward of his labors. On certain\\r\\nfamily festivals he received as a gratuity some little gift, to which\\r\\nMadame Guillaume\\'s dry and wrinkled hand alone gave value--netted\\r\\npurses, which she took care to stuff with cotton wool, to show off the\\r\\nfancy stitches, braces of the strongest make, or heavy silk stockings.\\r\\nSometimes, but rarely, this prime minister was admitted to share the\\r\\npleasures of the family when they went into the country, or when, after\\r\\nwaiting for months, they made up their mind to exert the right acquired\\r\\nby taking a box at the theatre to command a piece which Paris had\\r\\nalready forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the other assistants, the barrier of respect which formerly\\r\\ndivided a master draper from his apprentices was that they would\\r\\nhave been more likely to steal a piece of cloth than to infringe this\\r\\ntime-honored etiquette. Such reserve may now appear ridiculous; but\\r\\nthese old houses were a school of honesty and sound morals. The masters\\r\\nadopted their apprentices. The young man\\'s linen was cared for, mended,\\r\\nand often replaced by the mistress of the house. If an apprentice fell\\r\\nill, he was the object of truly maternal attention. In a case of\\r\\ndanger the master lavished his money in calling in the most celebrated\\r\\nphysicians, for he was not answerable to their parents merely for the\\r\\ngood conduct and training of the lads. If one of them, whose character\\r\\nwas unimpeachable, suffered misfortune, these old tradesmen knew how to\\r\\nvalue the intelligence he had displayed, and they did not hesitate\\r\\nto entrust the happiness of their daughters to men whom they had long\\r\\ntrusted with their fortunes. Guillaume was one of these men of the\\r\\nold school, and if he had their ridiculous side, he had all their good\\r\\nqualities; and Joseph Lebas, the chief assistant, an orphan without any\\r\\nfortune, was in his mind destined to be the husband of Virginie, his\\r\\nelder daughter. But Joseph did not share the symmetrical ideas of his\\r\\nmaster, who would not for an empire have given his second daughter in\\r\\nmarriage before the elder. The unhappy assistant felt that his heart was\\r\\nwholly given to Mademoiselle Augustine, the younger. In order to justify\\r\\nthis passion, which had grown up in secret, it is necessary to inquire\\r\\na little further into the springs of the absolute government which ruled\\r\\nthe old cloth-merchant\\'s household.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuillaume had two daughters. The elder, Mademoiselle Virginie, was\\r\\nthe very image of her mother. Madame Guillaume, daughter of the Sieur\\r\\nChevrel, sat so upright in the stool behind her desk, that more than\\r\\nonce she had heard some wag bet that she was a stuffed figure. Her\\r\\nlong, thin face betrayed exaggerated piety. Devoid of attractions or of\\r\\namiable manners, Madame Guillaume commonly decorated her head--that of\\r\\na woman near on sixty--with a cap of a particular and unvarying shape,\\r\\nwith long lappets, like that of a widow. In all the neighborhood she was\\r\\nknown as the \"portress nun.\" Her speech was curt, and her movements had\\r\\nthe stiff precision of a semaphore. Her eye, with a gleam in it like a\\r\\ncat\\'s, seemed to spite the world because she was so ugly. Mademoiselle\\r\\nVirginie, brought up, like her younger sister, under the domestic rule\\r\\nof her mother, had reached the age of eight-and-twenty. Youth mitigated\\r\\nthe graceless effect which her likeness to her mother sometimes gave\\r\\nto her features, but maternal austerity had endowed her with two great\\r\\nqualities which made up for everything. She was patient and gentle.\\r\\nMademoiselle Augustine, who was but just eighteen, was not like either\\r\\nher father or her mother. She was one of those daughters whose total\\r\\nabsence of any physical affinity with their parents makes one believe in\\r\\nthe adage: \"God gives children.\" Augustine was little, or, to describe\\r\\nher more truly, delicately made. Full of gracious candor, a man of the\\r\\nworld could have found no fault in the charming girl beyond a certain\\r\\nmeanness of gesture or vulgarity of attitude, and sometimes a want of\\r\\nease. Her silent and placid face was full of the transient melancholy\\r\\nwhich comes over all young girls who are too weak to dare to resist\\r\\ntheir mother\\'s will.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two sisters, always plainly dressed, could not gratify the innate\\r\\nvanity of womanhood but by a luxury of cleanliness which became them\\r\\nwonderfully, and made them harmonize with the polished counters and\\r\\nthe shining shelves, on which the old man-servant never left a speck of\\r\\ndust, and with the old-world simplicity of all they saw about them. As\\r\\ntheir style of living compelled them to find the elements of happiness\\r\\nin persistent work, Augustine and Virginie had hitherto always satisfied\\r\\ntheir mother, who secretly prided herself on the perfect characters of\\r\\nher two daughters. It is easy to imagine the results of the training\\r\\nthey had received. Brought up to a commercial life, accustomed to\\r\\nhear nothing but dreary arguments and calculations about trade, having\\r\\nstudied nothing but grammar, book-keeping, a little Bible-history, and\\r\\nthe history of France in Le Ragois, and never reading any book but what\\r\\ntheir mother would sanction, their ideas had not acquired much scope.\\r\\nThey knew perfectly how to keep house; they were familiar with the\\r\\nprices of things; they understood the difficulty of amassing money; they\\r\\nwere economical, and had a great respect for the qualities that make a\\r\\nman of business. Although their father was rich, they were as skilled\\r\\nin darning as in embroidery; their mother often talked of having them\\r\\ntaught to cook, so that they might know how to order a dinner and scold\\r\\na cook with due knowledge. They knew nothing of the pleasures of the\\r\\nworld; and, seeing how their parents spent their exemplary lives, they\\r\\nvery rarely suffered their eyes to wander beyond the walls of their\\r\\nhereditary home, which to their mother was the whole universe. The\\r\\nmeetings to which family anniversaries gave rise filled in the future of\\r\\nearthly joy to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the great drawing-room on the second floor was to be prepared to\\r\\nreceive company--Madame Roguin, a Demoiselle Chevrel, fifteen months\\r\\nyounger than her cousin, and bedecked with diamonds; young Rabourdin,\\r\\nemployed in the Finance Office; Monsieur Cesar Birotteau, the rich\\r\\nperfumer, and his wife, known as Madame Cesar; Monsieur Camusot, the\\r\\nrichest silk mercer in the Rue des Bourdonnais, with his father-in-law,\\r\\nMonsieur Cardot, two or three old bankers, and some immaculate\\r\\nladies--the arrangements, made necessary by the way in which everything\\r\\nwas packed away--the plate, the Dresden china, the candlesticks, and the\\r\\nglass--made a variety in the monotonous lives of the three women, who\\r\\ncame and went and exerted themselves as nuns would to receive their\\r\\nbishop. Then, in the evening, when all three were tired out with having\\r\\nwiped, rubbed, unpacked, and arranged all the gauds of the festival, as\\r\\nthe girls helped their mother to undress, Madame Guillaume would say to\\r\\nthem, \"Children, we have done nothing today.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, on very great occasions, \"the portress nun\" allowed dancing,\\r\\nrestricting the games of boston, whist, and backgammon within the limits\\r\\nof her bedroom, such a concession was accounted as the most unhoped\\r\\nfelicity, and made them happier than going to the great balls, to two\\r\\nor three of which Guillaume would take the girls at the time of the\\r\\nCarnival.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd once a year the worthy draper gave an entertainment, when he spared\\r\\nno expense. However rich and fashionable the persons invited might be,\\r\\nthey were careful not to be absent; for the most important houses on\\r\\nthe exchange had recourse to the immense credit, the fortune, or the\\r\\ntime-honored experience of Monsieur Guillaume. Still, the excellent\\r\\nmerchant\\'s daughters did not benefit as much as might be supposed by the\\r\\nlessons the world has to offer to young spirits. At these parties, which\\r\\nwere indeed set down in the ledger to the credit of the house, they wore\\r\\ndresses the shabbiness of which made them blush. Their style of dancing\\r\\nwas not in any way remarkable, and their mother\\'s surveillance did not\\r\\nallow of their holding any conversation with their partners beyond Yes\\r\\nand No. Also, the law of the old sign of the Cat and Racket commanded\\r\\nthat they should be home by eleven o\\'clock, the hour when balls and\\r\\nfetes begin to be lively. Thus their pleasures, which seemed to conform\\r\\nvery fairly to their father\\'s position, were often made insipid by\\r\\ncircumstances which were part of the family habits and principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to their usual life, one remark will sufficiently paint it. Madame\\r\\nGuillaume required her daughters to be dressed very early in the\\r\\nmorning, to come down every day at the same hour, and she ordered their\\r\\nemployments with monastic regularity. Augustine, however, had been\\r\\ngifted by chance with a spirit lofty enough to feel the emptiness of\\r\\nsuch a life. Her blue eyes would sometimes be raised as if to pierce\\r\\nthe depths of that gloomy staircase and those damp store-rooms. After\\r\\nsounding the profound cloistral silence, she seemed to be listening to\\r\\nremote, inarticulate revelations of the life of passion, which accounts\\r\\nfeelings as of higher value than things. And at such moments her cheek\\r\\nwould flush, her idle hands would lay the muslin sewing on the polished\\r\\noak counter, and presently her mother would say in a voice, of which\\r\\neven the softest tones were sour, \"Augustine, my treasure, what are\\r\\nyou thinking about?\" It is possible that two romances discovered\\r\\nby Augustine in the cupboard of a cook Madame Guillaume had\\r\\nlately discharged--_Hippolyte Comte de Douglas_ and _Le Comte de\\r\\nComminges_--may have contributed to develop the ideas of the young girl,\\r\\nwho had devoured them in secret, during the long nights of the past\\r\\nwinter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so Augustine\\'s expression of vague longing, her gentle voice, her\\r\\njasmine skin, and her blue eyes had lighted in poor Lebas\\' soul a\\r\\nflame as ardent as it was reverent. From an easily understood caprice,\\r\\nAugustine felt no affection for the orphan; perhaps she did not know\\r\\nthat he loved her. On the other hand, the senior apprentice, with his\\r\\nlong legs, his chestnut hair, his big hands and powerful frame, had\\r\\nfound a secret admirer in Mademoiselle Virginie, who, in spite of her\\r\\ndower of fifty thousand crowns, had as yet no suitor. Nothing could\\r\\nbe more natural than these two passions at cross-purposes, born in the\\r\\nsilence of the dingy shop, as violets bloom in the depths of a wood. The\\r\\nmute and constant looks which made the young people\\'s eyes meet by sheer\\r\\nneed of change in the midst of persistent work and cloistered peace, was\\r\\nsure, sooner or later, to give rise to feelings of love. The habit of\\r\\nseeing always the same face leads insensibly to our reading there the\\r\\nqualities of the soul, and at last effaces all its defects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the pace at which that man goes, our girls will soon have to go on\\r\\ntheir knees to a suitor!\" said Monsieur Guillaume to himself, as he\\r\\nread the first decree by which Napoleon drew in advance on the conscript\\r\\nclasses.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that day the old merchant, grieved at seeing his eldest daughter\\r\\nfade, remembered how he had married Mademoiselle Chevrel under much the\\r\\nsame circumstances as those of Joseph Lebas and Virginie. A good bit\\r\\nof business, to marry off his daughter, and discharge a sacred debt\\r\\nby repaying to an orphan the benefit he had formerly received from\\r\\nhis predecessor under similar conditions! Joseph Lebas, who was now\\r\\nthree-and-thirty, was aware of the obstacle which a difference of\\r\\nfifteen years placed between Augustine and himself. Being also too\\r\\nclear-sighted not to understand Monsieur Guillaume\\'s purpose, he knew\\r\\nhis inexorable principles well enough to feel sure that the second would\\r\\nnever marry before the elder. So the hapless assistant, whose heart was\\r\\nas warm as his legs were long and his chest deep, suffered in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the state of the affairs in the tiny republic which, in the\\r\\nheart of the Rue Saint-Denis, was not unlike a dependency of La Trappe.\\r\\nBut to give a full account of events as well as of feelings, it is\\r\\nneedful to go back to some months before the scene with which this story\\r\\nopens. At dusk one evening, a young man passing the darkened shop of the\\r\\nCat and Racket, had paused for a moment to gaze at a picture which might\\r\\nhave arrested every painter in the world. The shop was not yet lighted,\\r\\nand was as a dark cave beyond which the dining-room was visible. A\\r\\nhanging lamp shed the yellow light which lends such charm to pictures\\r\\nof the Dutch school. The white linen, the silver, the cut glass, were\\r\\nbrilliant accessories, and made more picturesque by strong contrasts of\\r\\nlight and shade. The figures of the head of the family and his wife, the\\r\\nfaces of the apprentices, and the pure form of Augustine, near whom a\\r\\nfat chubby-cheeked maid was standing, composed so strange a group; the\\r\\nheads were so singular, and every face had so candid an expression; it\\r\\nwas so easy to read the peace, the silence, the modest way of life in\\r\\nthis family, that to an artist accustomed to render nature, there was\\r\\nsomething hopeless in any attempt to depict this scene, come upon by\\r\\nchance. The stranger was a young painter, who, seven years before, had\\r\\ngained the first prize for painting. He had now just come back from\\r\\nRome. His soul, full-fed with poetry; his eyes, satiated with Raphael\\r\\nand Michael Angelo, thirsted for real nature after long dwelling in the\\r\\npompous land where art has everywhere left something grandiose. Right or\\r\\nwrong, this was his personal feeling. His heart, which had long been\\r\\na prey to the fire of Italian passion, craved one of those modest\\r\\nand meditative maidens whom in Rome he had unfortunately seen only\\r\\nin painting. From the enthusiasm produced in his excited fancy by the\\r\\nliving picture before him, he naturally passed to a profound admiration\\r\\nfor the principal figure; Augustine seemed to be pensive, and did not\\r\\neat; by the arrangement of the lamp the light fell full on her face, and\\r\\nher bust seemed to move in a circle of fire, which threw up the shape of\\r\\nher head and illuminated it with almost supernatural effect. The artist\\r\\ninvoluntarily compared her to an exiled angel dreaming of heaven. An\\r\\nalmost unknown emotion, a limpid, seething love flooded his heart. After\\r\\nremaining a minute, overwhelmed by the weight of his ideas, he tore\\r\\nhimself from his bliss, went home, ate nothing, and could not sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day he went to his studio, and did not come out of it till he\\r\\nhad placed on canvas the magic of the scene of which the memory had, in\\r\\na sense, made him a devotee; his happiness was incomplete till he should\\r\\npossess a faithful portrait of his idol. He went many times past the\\r\\nhouse of the Cat and Racket; he even ventured in once or twice, under\\r\\na disguise, to get a closer view of the bewitching creature that Madame\\r\\nGuillaume covered with her wing. For eight whole months, devoted to his\\r\\nlove and to his brush, he was lost to the sight of his most intimate\\r\\nfriends forgetting the world, the theatre, poetry, music, and all his\\r\\ndearest habits. One morning Girodet broke through all the barriers with\\r\\nwhich artists are familiar, and which they know how to evade, went into\\r\\nhis room, and woke him by asking, \"What are you going to send to the\\r\\nSalon?\" The artist grasped his friend\\'s hand, dragged him off to the\\r\\nstudio, uncovered a small easel picture and a portrait. After a long\\r\\nand eager study of the two masterpieces, Girodet threw himself on his\\r\\ncomrade\\'s neck and hugged him, without speaking a word. His feelings\\r\\ncould only be expressed as he felt them--soul to soul.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are in love?\" said Girodet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both knew that the finest portraits by Titian, Raphael, and\\r\\nLeonardo da Vinci, were the outcome of the enthusiastic sentiments\\r\\nby which, indeed, under various conditions, every masterpiece is\\r\\nengendered. The artist only bent his head in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How happy are you to be able to be in love, here, after coming back\\r\\nfrom Italy! But I do not advise you to send such works as these to the\\r\\nSalon,\" the great painter went on. \"You see, these two works will not\\r\\nbe appreciated. Such true coloring, such prodigious work, cannot yet be\\r\\nunderstood; the public is not accustomed to such depths. The pictures\\r\\nwe paint, my dear fellow, are mere screens. We should do better to\\r\\nturn rhymes, and translate the antique poets! There is more glory to be\\r\\nlooked for there than from our luckless canvases!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding this charitable advice, the two pictures were exhibited.\\r\\nThe _Interior_ made a revolution in painting. It gave birth to the\\r\\npictures of genre which pour into all our exhibitions in such prodigious\\r\\nquantity that they might be supposed to be produced by machinery. As\\r\\nto the portrait, few artists have forgotten that lifelike work; and the\\r\\npublic, which as a body is sometimes discerning, awarded it the crown\\r\\nwhich Girodet himself had hung over it. The two pictures were surrounded\\r\\nby a vast throng. They fought for places, as women say. Speculators and\\r\\nmoneyed men would have covered the canvas with double napoleons, but the\\r\\nartist obstinately refused to sell or to make replicas. An enormous sum\\r\\nwas offered him for the right of engraving them, and the print-sellers\\r\\nwere not more favored than the amateurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough these incidents occupied the world, they were not of a nature to\\r\\npenetrate the recesses of the monastic solitude in the Rue Saint-Denis.\\r\\nHowever, when paying a visit to Madame Guillaume, the notary\\'s wife\\r\\nspoke of the exhibition before Augustine, of whom she was very fond,\\r\\nand explained its purpose. Madame Roguin\\'s gossip naturally inspired\\r\\nAugustine with a wish to see the pictures, and with courage enough to\\r\\nask her cousin secretly to take her to the Louvre. Her cousin succeeded\\r\\nin the negotiations she opened with Madame Guillaume for permission to\\r\\nrelease the young girl for two hours from her dull labors. Augustine was\\r\\nthus able to make her way through the crowd to see the crowned work. A\\r\\nfit of trembling shook her like an aspen leaf as she recognized herself.\\r\\nShe was terrified, and looked about her to find Madame Roguin, from\\r\\nwhom she had been separated by a tide of people. At that moment her\\r\\nfrightened eyes fell on the impassioned face of the young painter. She\\r\\nat once recalled the figure of a loiterer whom, being curious, she had\\r\\nfrequently observed, believing him to be a new neighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see how love has inspired me,\" said the artist in the timid\\r\\ncreature\\'s ear, and she stood in dismay at the words.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found supernatural courage to enable her to push through the crowd\\r\\nand join her cousin, who was still struggling with the mass of people\\r\\nthat hindered her from getting to the picture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will be stifled!\" cried Augustine. \"Let us go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there are moments, at the Salon, when two women are not always free\\r\\nto direct their steps through the galleries. By the irregular course to\\r\\nwhich they were compelled by the press, Mademoiselle Guillaume and her\\r\\ncousin were pushed to within a few steps of the second picture. Chance\\r\\nthus brought them, both together, to where they could easily see the\\r\\ncanvas made famous by fashion, for once in agreement with talent. Madame\\r\\nRoguin\\'s exclamation of surprise was lost in the hubbub and buzz of the\\r\\ncrowd; Augustine involuntarily shed tears at the sight of this wonderful\\r\\nstudy. Then, by an almost unaccountable impulse, she laid her finger on\\r\\nher lips, as she perceived quite near her the ecstatic face of the young\\r\\npainter. The stranger replied by a nod, and pointed to Madame Roguin, as\\r\\na spoil-sport, to show Augustine that he had understood. This pantomime\\r\\nstruck the young girl like hot coals on her flesh; she felt quite\\r\\nguilty as she perceived that there was a compact between herself and the\\r\\nartist. The suffocating heat, the dazzling sight of beautiful dresses,\\r\\nthe bewilderment produced in Augustine\\'s brain by the truth of coloring,\\r\\nthe multitude of living or painted figures, the profusion of gilt\\r\\nframes, gave her a sense of intoxication which doubled her alarms. She\\r\\nwould perhaps have fainted if an unknown rapture had not surged up\\r\\nin her heart to vivify her whole being, in spite of this chaos of\\r\\nsensations. She nevertheless believed herself to be under the power\\r\\nof the Devil, of whose awful snares she had been warned of by the\\r\\nthundering words of preachers. This moment was to her like a moment of\\r\\nmadness. She found herself accompanied to her cousin\\'s carriage by the\\r\\nyoung man, radiant with joy and love. Augustine, a prey to an agitation\\r\\nnew to her experience, an intoxication which seemed to abandon her to\\r\\nnature, listened to the eloquent voice of her heart, and looked again\\r\\nand again at the young painter, betraying the emotion that came over\\r\\nher. Never had the bright rose of her cheeks shown in stronger contrast\\r\\nwith the whiteness of her skin. The artist saw her beauty in all its\\r\\nbloom, her maiden modesty in all its glory. She herself felt a sort of\\r\\nrapture mingled with terror at thinking that her presence had brought\\r\\nhappiness to him whose name was on every lip, and whose talent lent\\r\\nimmortality to transient scenes. She was loved! It was impossible to\\r\\ndoubt it. When she no longer saw the artist, these simple words still\\r\\nechoed in her ear, \"You see how love has inspired me!\" And the throbs of\\r\\nher heart, as they grew deeper, seemed a pain, her heated blood revealed\\r\\nso many unknown forces in her being. She affected a severe headache to\\r\\navoid replying to her cousin\\'s questions concerning the pictures; but\\r\\non their return Madame Roguin could not forbear from speaking to Madame\\r\\nGuillaume of the fame that had fallen on the house of the Cat and\\r\\nRacket, and Augustine quaked in every limb as she heard her mother say\\r\\nthat she should go to the Salon to see her house there. The young girl\\r\\nagain declared herself suffering, and obtained leave to go to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what comes of sight-seeing,\" exclaimed Monsieur Guillaume--\"a\\r\\nheadache. And is it so very amusing to see in a picture what you can\\r\\nsee any day in your own street? Don\\'t talk to me of your artists! Like\\r\\nwriters, they are a starveling crew. Why the devil need they choose my\\r\\nhouse to flout it in their pictures?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may help to sell a few ells more of cloth,\" said Joseph Lebas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis remark did not protect art and thought from being condemned once\\r\\nagain before the judgment-seat of trade. As may be supposed, these\\r\\nspeeches did not infuse much hope into Augustine, who, during the night,\\r\\ngave herself up to the first meditations of love. The events of the day\\r\\nwere like a dream, which it was a joy to recall to her mind. She was\\r\\ninitiated into the fears, the hopes, the remorse, all the ebb and flow\\r\\nof feeling which could not fail to toss a heart so simple and timid as\\r\\nhers. What a void she perceived in this gloomy house! What a treasure\\r\\nshe found in her soul! To be the wife of a genius, to share his glory!\\r\\nWhat ravages must such a vision make in the heart of a girl brought up\\r\\namong such a family! What hopes must it raise in a young creature who,\\r\\nin the midst of sordid elements, had pined for a life of elegance! A\\r\\nsunbeam had fallen into the prison. Augustine was suddenly in love. So\\r\\nmany of her feelings were soothed that she succumbed without reflection.\\r\\nAt eighteen does not love hold a prism between the world and the eyes\\r\\nof a young girl? She was incapable of suspecting the hard facts which\\r\\nresult from the union of a loving woman with a man of imagination, and\\r\\nshe believed herself called to make him happy, not seeing any disparity\\r\\nbetween herself and him. To her the future would be as the present.\\r\\nWhen, next day, her father and mother returned from the Salon, their\\r\\ndejected faces proclaimed some disappointment. In the first place, the\\r\\npainter had removed the two pictures; and then Madame Guillaume had lost\\r\\nher cashmere shawl. But the news that the pictures had disappeared from\\r\\nthe walls since her visit revealed to Augustine a delicacy of sentiment\\r\\nwhich a woman can always appreciate, even by instinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning when, on his way home from a ball, Theodore de\\r\\nSommervieux--for this was the name which fame had stamped on Augustine\\'s\\r\\nheart--had been squirted on by the apprentices while awaiting the\\r\\nappearance of his artless little friend, who certainly did not know that\\r\\nhe was there, the lovers had seen each other for the fourth time only\\r\\nsince their meeting at the Salon. The difficulties which the rule of\\r\\nthe house placed in the way of the painter\\'s ardent nature gave added\\r\\nviolence to his passion for Augustine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow could he get near to a young girl seated in a counting-house between\\r\\ntwo such women as Mademoiselle Virginie and Madame Guillaume? How could\\r\\nhe correspond with her when her mother never left her side? Ingenious,\\r\\nas lovers are, to imagine woes, Theodore saw a rival in one of the\\r\\nassistants, to whose interests he supposed the others to be devoted. If\\r\\nhe should evade these sons of Argus, he would yet be wrecked under the\\r\\nstern eye of the old draper or of Madame Guillaume. The very vehemence\\r\\nof his passion hindered the young painter from hitting on the ingenious\\r\\nexpedients which, in prisoners and in lovers, seem to be the last effort\\r\\nof intelligence spurred by a wild craving for liberty, or by the fire of\\r\\nlove. Theodore wandered about the neighborhood with the restlessness of\\r\\na madman, as though movement might inspire him with some device.\\r\\nAfter racking his imagination, it occurred to him to bribe the blowsy\\r\\nwaiting-maid with gold. Thus a few notes were exchanged at long\\r\\nintervals during the fortnight following the ill-starred morning when\\r\\nMonsieur Guillaume and Theodore had so scrutinized one another. At\\r\\nthe present moment the young couple had agreed to see each other at a\\r\\ncertain hour of the day, and on Sunday, at Saint-Leu, during Mass and\\r\\nvespers. Augustine had sent her dear Theodore a list of the relations\\r\\nand friends of the family, to whom the young painter tried to get\\r\\naccess, in the hope of interesting, if it were possible, in his love\\r\\naffairs, one of these souls absorbed in money and trade, to whom a\\r\\ngenuine passion must appear a quite monstrous speculation, a thing\\r\\nunheard-of. Nothing meanwhile, was altered at the sign of the Cat and\\r\\nRacket. If Augustine was absent-minded, if, against all obedience to the\\r\\ndomestic code, she stole up to her room to make signals by means of\\r\\na jar of flowers, if she sighed, if she were lost in thought, no one\\r\\nobserved it, not even her mother. This will cause some surprise to those\\r\\nwho have entered into the spirit of the household, where an idea tainted\\r\\nwith poetry would be in startling contrast to persons and things, where\\r\\nno one could venture on a gesture or a look which would not be seen and\\r\\nanalyzed. Nothing, however, could be more natural: the quiet barque that\\r\\nnavigated the stormy waters of the Paris Exchange, under the flag of\\r\\nthe Cat and Racket, was just now in the toils of one of these tempests\\r\\nwhich, returning periodically, might be termed equinoctial. For the\\r\\nlast fortnight the five men forming the crew, with Madame Guillaume and\\r\\nMademoiselle Virginie, had been devoting themselves to the hard labor,\\r\\nknown as stock-taking.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery bale was turned over, and the length verified to ascertain the\\r\\nexact value of the remnant. The ticket attached to each parcel was\\r\\ncarefully examined to see at what time the piece had been bought. The\\r\\nretail price was fixed. Monsieur Guillaume, always on his feet, his pen\\r\\nbehind his ear, was like a captain commanding the working of the ship.\\r\\nHis sharp tones, spoken through a trap-door, to inquire into the\\r\\ndepths of the hold in the cellar-store, gave utterance to the barbarous\\r\\nformulas of trade-jargon, which find expression only in cipher. \"How\\r\\nmuch H. N. Z.?\"--\"All sold.\"--\"What is left of Q. X.?\"--\"Two ells.\"--\"At\\r\\nwhat price?\"--\"Fifty-five three.\"--\"Set down A. at three, with all of\\r\\nJ. J., all of M. P., and what is left of V. D. O.\"--A hundred other\\r\\ninjunctions equally intelligible were spouted over the counters like\\r\\nverses of modern poetry, quoted by romantic spirits, to excite each\\r\\nother\\'s enthusiasm for one of their poets. In the evening Guillaume,\\r\\nshut up with his assistant and his wife, balanced his accounts, carried\\r\\non the balance, wrote to debtors in arrears, and made out bills. All\\r\\nthree were busy over this enormous labor, of which the result could be\\r\\nstated on a sheet of foolscap, proving to the head of the house that\\r\\nthere was so much to the good in hard cash, so much in goods, so much\\r\\nin bills and notes; that he did not owe a sou; that a hundred or two\\r\\nhundred thousand francs were owing to him; that the capital had been\\r\\nincreased; that the farmlands, the houses, or the investments were\\r\\nextended, or repaired, or doubled. Whence it became necessary to begin\\r\\nagain with increased ardor, to accumulate more crown-pieces, without its\\r\\never entering the brain of these laborious ants to ask--\"To what end?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFavored by this annual turmoil, the happy Augustine escaped the\\r\\ninvestigations of her Argus-eyed relations. At last, one Saturday\\r\\nevening, the stock-taking was finished. The figures of the sum-total\\r\\nshowed a row of 0\\'s long enough to allow Guillaume for once to relax the\\r\\nstern rule as to dessert which reigned throughout the year. The shrewd\\r\\nold draper rubbed his hands, and allowed his assistants to remain at\\r\\ntable. The members of the crew had hardly swallowed their thimbleful\\r\\nof some home-made liqueur, when the rumble of a carriage was heard. The\\r\\nfamily party were going to see _Cendrillon_ at the Varietes, while\\r\\nthe two younger apprentices each received a crown of six francs, with\\r\\npermission to go wherever they chose, provided they were in by midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding this debauch, the old cloth-merchant was shaving himself\\r\\nat six next morning, put on his maroon-colored coat, of which the\\r\\nglowing lights afforded him perennial enjoyment, fastened a pair of gold\\r\\nbuckles on the knee-straps of his ample satin breeches; and then, at\\r\\nabout seven o\\'clock, while all were still sleeping in the house, he\\r\\nmade his way to the little office adjoining the shop on the first floor.\\r\\nDaylight came in through a window, fortified by iron bars, and looking\\r\\nout on a small yard surrounded by such black walls that it was very like\\r\\na well. The old merchant opened the iron-lined shutters, which were so\\r\\nfamiliar to him, and threw up the lower half of the sash window. The icy\\r\\nair of the courtyard came in to cool the hot atmosphere of the little\\r\\nroom, full of the odor peculiar to offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe merchant remained standing, his hand resting on the greasy arm of\\r\\na large cane chair lined with morocco, of which the original hue had\\r\\ndisappeared; he seemed to hesitate as to seating himself. He looked with\\r\\naffection at the double desk, where his wife\\'s seat, opposite his own,\\r\\nwas fitted into a little niche in the wall. He contemplated the\\r\\nnumbered boxes, the files, the implements, the cash box--objects all\\r\\nof immemorial origin, and fancied himself in the room with the shade of\\r\\nMaster Chevrel. He even pulled out the high stool on which he had once\\r\\nsat in the presence of his departed master. This stool, covered with\\r\\nblack leather, the horse-hair showing at every corner--as it had long\\r\\ndone, without, however, coming out--he placed with a shaking hand on the\\r\\nvery spot where his predecessor had put it, and then, with an emotion\\r\\ndifficult to describe, he pulled a bell, which rang at the head of\\r\\nJoseph Lebas\\' bed. When this decisive blow had been struck, the old man,\\r\\nfor whom, no doubt, these reminiscences were too much, took up three or\\r\\nfour bills of exchange, and looked at them without seeing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Joseph Lebas stood before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit down there,\" said Guillaume, pointing to the stool.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the old master draper had never yet bid his assistant be seated in\\r\\nhis presence, Joseph Lebas was startled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of these notes?\" asked Guillaume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They will never be paid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I heard the day before yesterday Etienne and Co. had made their\\r\\npayments in gold.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, oh!\" said the draper. \"Well, one must be very ill to show one\\'s\\r\\nbile. Let us speak of something else.--Joseph, the stock-taking is\\r\\ndone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, monsieur, and the dividend is one of the best you have ever made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not use new-fangled words. Say the profits, Joseph. Do you know, my\\r\\nboy, that this result is partly owing to you? And I do not intend to pay\\r\\nyou a salary any longer. Madame Guillaume has suggested to me to take\\r\\nyou into partnership.--\\'Guillaume and Lebas;\\' will not that make a\\r\\ngood business name? We might add, \\'and Co.\\' to round off the firm\\'s\\r\\nsignature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTears rose to the eyes of Joseph Lebas, who tried to hide them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Monsieur Guillaume, how have I deserved such kindness? I only do my\\r\\nduty. It was so much already that you should take an interest in a poor\\r\\norph----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was brushing the cuff of his left sleeve with his right hand, and\\r\\ndared not look at the old man, who smiled as he thought that this modest\\r\\nyoung fellow no doubt needed, as he had needed once on a time, some\\r\\nencouragement to complete his explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said Virginie\\'s father, \"you do not altogether deserve\\r\\nthis favor, Joseph. You have not so much confidence in me as I have in\\r\\nyou.\" (The young man looked up quickly.) \"You know all the secrets\\r\\nof the cash-box. For the last two years I have told you almost all\\r\\nmy concerns. I have sent you to travel in our goods. In short, I have\\r\\nnothing on my conscience as regards you. But you--you have a soft place,\\r\\nand you have never breathed a word of it.\" Joseph Lebas blushed. \"Ah,\\r\\nha!\" cried Guillaume, \"so you thought you could deceive an old fox like\\r\\nme? When you knew that I had scented the Lecocq bankruptcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, monsieur?\" replied Joseph Lebas, looking at his master as keenly\\r\\nas his master looked at him, \"you knew that I was in love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know everything, you rascal,\" said the worthy and cunning old\\r\\nmerchant, pulling the assistant\\'s ear. \"And I forgive you--I did the\\r\\nsame myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you will give her to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes--with fifty thousand crowns; and I will leave you as much by will,\\r\\nand we will start on our new career under the name of a new firm. We\\r\\nwill do good business yet, my boy!\" added the old man, getting up and\\r\\nflourishing his arms. \"I tell you, son-in-law, there is nothing like\\r\\ntrade. Those who ask what pleasure is to be found in it are simpletons.\\r\\nTo be on the scent of a good bargain, to hold your own on \\'Change, to\\r\\nwatch as anxiously as at the gaming-table whether Etienne and Co. will\\r\\nfail or no, to see a regiment of Guards march past all dressed in your\\r\\ncloth, to trip your neighbor up--honestly of course!--to make the goods\\r\\ncheaper than others can; then to carry out an undertaking which you\\r\\nhave planned, which begins, grows, totters, and succeeds! to know the\\r\\nworkings of every house of business as well as a minister of police, so\\r\\nas never to make a mistake; to hold up your head in the midst of wrecks,\\r\\nto have friends by correspondence in every manufacturing town; is not\\r\\nthat a perpetual game, Joseph? That is life, that is! I shall die in\\r\\nthat harness, like old Chevrel, but taking it easy now, all the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the heat of his eager rhetoric, old Guillaume had scarcely looked\\r\\nat his assistant, who was weeping copiously. \"Why, Joseph, my poor boy,\\r\\nwhat is the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I love her so! Monsieur Guillaume, that my heart fails me; I\\r\\nbelieve----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, boy,\" said the old man, touched, \"you are happier than you\\r\\nknow, by God! For she loves you. I know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he blinked his little green eyes as he looked at the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mademoiselle Augustine! Mademoiselle Augustine!\" exclaimed Joseph Lebas\\r\\nin his rapture.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was about to rush out of the room when he felt himself clutched by a\\r\\nhand of iron, and his astonished master spun him round in front of him\\r\\nonce more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What has Augustine to do with this matter?\" he asked, in a voice which\\r\\ninstantly froze the luckless Joseph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it not she that--that--I love?\" stammered the assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch put out by his own want of perspicacity, Guillaume sat down\\r\\nagain, and rested his long head in his hands to consider the perplexing\\r\\nsituation in which he found himself. Joseph Lebas, shamefaced and in\\r\\ndespair, remained standing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Joseph,\" the draper said with frigid dignity, \"I was speaking of\\r\\nVirginie. Love cannot be made to order, I know. I know, too, that you\\r\\ncan be trusted. We will forget all this. I will not let Augustine marry\\r\\nbefore Virginie.--Your interest will be ten per cent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man, to whom love gave I know not what power of courage and\\r\\neloquence, clasped his hand, and spoke in his turn--spoke for a quarter\\r\\nof an hour, with so much warmth and feeling, that he altered the\\r\\nsituation. If the question had been a matter of business the old\\r\\ntradesman would have had fixed principles to guide his decision; but,\\r\\ntossed a thousand miles from commerce, on the ocean of sentiment,\\r\\nwithout a compass, he floated, as he told himself, undecided in the face\\r\\nof such an unexpected event. Carried away by his fatherly kindness, he\\r\\nbegan to beat about the bush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Deuce take it, Joseph, you must know that there are ten years between\\r\\nmy two children. Mademoiselle Chevrel was no beauty, still she has had\\r\\nnothing to complain of in me. Do as I did. Come, come, don\\'t cry. Can\\r\\nyou be so silly? What is to be done? It can be managed perhaps. There\\r\\nis always some way out of a scrape. And we men are not always devoted\\r\\nCeladons to our wives--you understand? Madame Guillaume is very pious.\\r\\n... Come. By Gad, boy, give your arm to Augustine this morning as we go\\r\\nto Mass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the phrases spoken at random by the old draper, and their\\r\\nconclusion made the lover happy. He was already thinking of a friend of\\r\\nhis as a match for Mademoiselle Virginie, as he went out of the smoky\\r\\noffice, pressing his future father-in-law\\'s hand, after saying with a\\r\\nknowing look that all would turn out for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What will Madame Guillaume say to it?\" was the idea that greatly\\r\\ntroubled the worthy merchant when he found himself alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt breakfast Madame Guillaume and Virginie, to whom the draper had not\\r\\nyet confided his disappointment, cast meaning glances at Joseph Lebas,\\r\\nwho was extremely embarrassed. The young assistant\\'s bashfulness\\r\\ncommended him to his mother-in-law\\'s good graces. The matron became\\r\\nso cheerful that she smiled as she looked at her husband, and allowed\\r\\nherself some little pleasantries of time-honored acceptance in such\\r\\nsimple families. She wondered whether Joseph or Virginie were the\\r\\ntaller, to ask them to compare their height. This preliminary fooling\\r\\nbrought a cloud to the master\\'s brow, and he even made such a point of\\r\\ndecorum that he desired Augustine to take the assistant\\'s arm on their\\r\\nway to Saint-Leu. Madame Guillaume, surprised at this manly delicacy,\\r\\nhonored her husband with a nod of approval. So the procession left\\r\\nthe house in such order as to suggest no suspicious meaning to the\\r\\nneighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does it not seem to you, Mademoiselle Augustine,\" said the assistant,\\r\\nand he trembled, \"that the wife of a merchant whose credit is as good\\r\\nas Monsieur Guillaume\\'s, for instance, might enjoy herself a little more\\r\\nthan Madame your mother does? Might wear diamonds--or keep a carriage?\\r\\nFor my part, if I were to marry, I should be glad to take all the work,\\r\\nand see my wife happy. I would not put her into the counting-house.\\r\\nIn the drapery business, you see, a woman is not so necessary now as\\r\\nformerly. Monsieur Guillaume was quite right to act as he did--and\\r\\nbesides, his wife liked it. But so long as a woman knows how to turn her\\r\\nhand to the book-keeping, the correspondence, the retail business, the\\r\\norders, and her housekeeping, so as not to sit idle, that is enough. At\\r\\nseven o\\'clock, when the shop is shut, I shall take my pleasures, go to\\r\\nthe play, and into company.--But you are not listening to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, Monsieur Joseph. What do you think of painting? That is a\\r\\nfine calling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. I know a master house-painter, Monsieur Lourdois. He is\\r\\nwell-to-do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus conversing, the family reached the Church of Saint-Leu. There\\r\\nMadame Guillaume reasserted her rights, and, for the first time, placed\\r\\nAugustine next herself, Virginie taking her place on the fourth chair,\\r\\nnext to Lebas. During the sermon all went well between Augustine and\\r\\nTheodore, who, standing behind a pillar, worshiped his Madonna with\\r\\nfervent devotion; but at the elevation of the Host, Madame Guillaume\\r\\ndiscovered, rather late, that her daughter Augustine was holding her\\r\\nprayer-book upside down. She was about to speak to her strongly, when,\\r\\nlowering her veil, she interrupted her own devotions to look in the\\r\\ndirection where her daughter\\'s eyes found attraction. By the help of her\\r\\nspectacles she saw the young artist, whose fashionable elegance seemed\\r\\nto proclaim him a cavalry officer on leave rather than a tradesman of\\r\\nthe neighborhood. It is difficult to conceive of the state of violent\\r\\nagitation in which Madame Guillaume found herself--she, who flattered\\r\\nherself on having brought up her daughters to perfection--on discovering\\r\\nin Augustine a clandestine passion of which her prudery and ignorance\\r\\nexaggerated the perils. She believed her daughter to be cankered to the\\r\\ncore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold your book right way up, miss,\" she muttered in a low voice,\\r\\ntremulous with wrath. She snatched away the tell-tale prayer-book and\\r\\nreturned it with the letter-press right way up. \"Do not allow your\\r\\neyes to look anywhere but at your prayers,\" she added, \"or I shall\\r\\nhave something to say to you. Your father and I will talk to you after\\r\\nchurch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words came like a thunderbolt on poor Augustine. She felt faint;\\r\\nbut, torn between the distress she felt and the dread of causing a\\r\\ncommotion in church she bravely concealed her anguish. It was, however,\\r\\neasy to discern the stormy state of her soul from the trembling of her\\r\\nprayer-book, and the tears which dropped on every page she turned. From\\r\\nthe furious glare shot at him by Madame Guillaume the artist saw the\\r\\nperil into which his love affair had fallen; he went out, with a raging\\r\\nsoul, determined to venture all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go to your room, miss!\" said Madame Guillaume, on their return home;\\r\\n\"we will send for you, but take care not to quit it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conference between the husband and wife was conducted so secretly\\r\\nthat at first nothing was heard of it. Virginie, however, who had tried\\r\\nto give her sister courage by a variety of gentle remonstrances, carried\\r\\nher good nature so far as to listen at the door of her mother\\'s bedroom\\r\\nwhere the discussion was held, to catch a word or two. The first time\\r\\nshe went down to the lower floor she heard her father exclaim, \"Then,\\r\\nmadame, do you wish to kill your daughter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My poor dear!\" said Virginie, in tears, \"papa takes your part.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what do they want to do to Theodore?\" asked the innocent girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirginie, inquisitive, went down again; but this time she stayed longer;\\r\\nshe learned that Joseph Lebas loved Augustine. It was written that on\\r\\nthis memorable day, this house, generally so peaceful, should be a hell.\\r\\nMonsieur Guillaume brought Joseph Lebas to despair by telling him of\\r\\nAugustine\\'s love for a stranger. Lebas, who had advised his friend to\\r\\nbecome a suitor for Mademoiselle Virginie, saw all his hopes wrecked.\\r\\nMademoiselle Virginie, overcome by hearing that Joseph had, in a way,\\r\\nrefused her, had a sick headache. The dispute that had arisen from the\\r\\ndiscussion between Monsieur and Madame Guillaume, when, for the third\\r\\ntime in their lives, they had been of antagonistic opinions, had shown\\r\\nitself in a terrible form. Finally, at half-past four in the afternoon,\\r\\nAugustine, pale, trembling, and with red eyes, was haled before her\\r\\nfather and mother. The poor child artlessly related the too brief tale\\r\\nof her love. Reassured by a speech from her father, who promised to\\r\\nlisten to her in silence, she gathered courage as she pronounced to her\\r\\nparents the name of Theodore de Sommervieux, with a mischievous little\\r\\nemphasis on the aristocratic _de_. And yielding to the unknown charm of\\r\\ntalking of her feelings, she was brave enough to declare with innocent\\r\\ndecision that she loved Monsieur de Sommervieux, that she had written to\\r\\nhim, and she added, with tears in her eyes: \"To sacrifice me to another\\r\\nman would make me wretched.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Augustine, you cannot surely know what a painter is?\" cried her\\r\\nmother with horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madame Guillaume!\" said the old man, compelling her to\\r\\nsilence.--\"Augustine,\" he went on, \"artists are generally little better\\r\\nthan beggars. They are too extravagant not to be always a bad sort. I\\r\\nserved the late Monsieur Joseph Vernet, the late Monsieur Lekain, and\\r\\nthe late Monsieur Noverre. Oh, if you could only know the tricks played\\r\\non poor Father Chevrel by that Monsieur Noverre, by the Chevalier de\\r\\nSaint-Georges, and especially by Monsieur Philidor! They are a set of\\r\\nrascals; I know them well! They all have a gab and nice manners. Ah,\\r\\nyour Monsieur Sumer--, Somm----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"De Sommervieux, papa.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, de Sommervieux, well and good. He can never have been half\\r\\nso sweet to you as Monsieur le Chevalier de Saint-Georges was to me the\\r\\nday I got a verdict of the consuls against him. And in those days they\\r\\nwere gentlemen of quality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, father, Monsieur Theodore is of good family, and he wrote me that\\r\\nhe is rich; his father was called Chevalier de Sommervieux before the\\r\\nRevolution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words Monsieur Guillaume looked at his terrible better half,\\r\\nwho, like an angry woman, sat tapping the floor with her foot while\\r\\nkeeping sullen silence; she avoided even casting wrathful looks\\r\\nat Augustine, appearing to leave to Monsieur Guillaume the whole\\r\\nresponsibility in so grave a matter, since her opinion was not listened\\r\\nto. Nevertheless, in spite of her apparent self-control, when she\\r\\nsaw her husband giving way so mildly under a catastrophe which had no\\r\\nconcern with business, she exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, monsieur, you are so weak with your daughters! However----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of a carriage, which stopped at the door, interrupted the\\r\\nrating which the old draper already quaked at. In a minute Madame Roguin\\r\\nwas standing in the middle of the room, and looking at the actors in\\r\\nthis domestic scene: \"I know all, my dear cousin,\" said she, with a\\r\\npatronizing air.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Roguin made the great mistake of supposing that a Paris notary\\'s\\r\\nwife could play the part of a favorite of fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know all,\" she repeated, \"and I have come into Noah\\'s Ark, like\\r\\nthe dove, with the olive-branch. I read that allegory in the _Genie du\\r\\nChristianisme_,\" she added, turning to Madame Guillaume; \"the allusion\\r\\nought to please you, cousin. Do you know,\" she went on, smiling at\\r\\nAugustine, \"that Monsieur de Sommervieux is a charming man? He gave me\\r\\nmy portrait this morning, painted by a master\\'s hand. It is worth at\\r\\nleast six thousand francs.\" And at these words she patted Monsieur\\r\\nGuillaume on the arm. The old draper could not help making a grimace\\r\\nwith his lips, which was peculiar to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know Monsieur de Sommervieux very well,\" the Dove ran on. \"He has\\r\\ncome to my evenings this fortnight past, and made them delightful. He\\r\\nhas told me all his woes, and commissioned me to plead for him. I know\\r\\nsince this morning that he adores Augustine, and he shall have her. Ah,\\r\\ncousin, do not shake your head in refusal. He will be created Baron, I\\r\\ncan tell you, and has just been made Chevalier of the Legion of Honor,\\r\\nby the Emperor himself, at the Salon. Roguin is now his lawyer, and\\r\\nknows all his affairs. Well! Monsieur de Sommervieux has twelve thousand\\r\\nfrancs a year in good landed estate. Do you know that the father-in-law\\r\\nof such a man may get a rise in life--be mayor of his _arrondissement_,\\r\\nfor instance. Have we not seen Monsieur Dupont become a Count of the\\r\\nEmpire, and a senator, all because he went as mayor to congratulate the\\r\\nEmperor on his entry into Vienna? Oh, this marriage must take place! For\\r\\nmy part, I adore the dear young man. His behavior to Augustine is only\\r\\nmet with in romances. Be easy, little one, you shall be happy, and every\\r\\ngirl will wish she were in your place. Madame la Duchesse de Carigliano,\\r\\nwho comes to my \\'At Homes,\\' raves about Monsieur de Sommervieux. Some\\r\\nspiteful people say she only comes to me to meet him; as if a duchesse\\r\\nof yesterday was doing too much honor to a Chevrel, whose family have\\r\\nbeen respected citizens these hundred years!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Augustine,\" Madame Roguin went on, after a short pause, \"I have seen\\r\\nthe portrait. Heavens! How lovely it is! Do you know that the Emperor\\r\\nwanted to have it? He laughed, and said to the Deputy High Constable\\r\\nthat if there were many women like that in his court while all the kings\\r\\nvisited it, he should have no difficulty about preserving the peace of\\r\\nEurope. Is not that a compliment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tempests with which the day had begun were to resemble those of\\r\\nnature, by ending in clear and serene weather. Madame Roguin displayed\\r\\nso much address in her harangue, she was able to touch so many strings\\r\\nin the dry hearts of Monsieur and Madame Guillaume, that at last she hit\\r\\non one which she could work upon. At this strange period commerce and\\r\\nfinance were more than ever possessed by the crazy mania for seeking\\r\\nalliance with rank; and the generals of the Empire took full advantage\\r\\nof this desire. Monsieur Guillaume, as a singular exception, opposed\\r\\nthis deplorable craving. His favorite axioms were that, to secure\\r\\nhappiness, a woman must marry a man of her own class; that every one was\\r\\npunished sooner or later for having climbed too high; that love could\\r\\nso little endure under the worries of a household, that both husband and\\r\\nwife needed sound good qualities to be happy, that it would not do for\\r\\none to be far in advance of the other, because, above everything, they\\r\\nmust understand each other; if a man spoke Greek and his wife Latin,\\r\\nthey might come to die of hunger. He had himself invented this sort\\r\\nof adage. And he compared such marriages to old-fashioned materials of\\r\\nmixed silk and wool. Still, there is so much vanity at the bottom of\\r\\nman\\'s heart that the prudence of the pilot who steered the Cat and\\r\\nRacket so wisely gave way before Madame Roguin\\'s aggressive volubility.\\r\\nAustere Madame Guillaume was the first to see in her daughter\\'s\\r\\naffection a reason for abdicating her principles and for consenting to\\r\\nreceive Monsieur de Sommervieux, whom she promised herself she would put\\r\\nunder severe inquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old draper went to look for Joseph Lebas, and inform him of the\\r\\nstate of affairs. At half-past six, the dining-room immortalized by the\\r\\nartist saw, united under its skylight, Monsieur and Madame Roguin, the\\r\\nyoung painter and his charming Augustine, Joseph Lebas, who found his\\r\\nhappiness in patience, and Mademoiselle Virginie, convalescent from her\\r\\nheadache. Monsieur and Madame Guillaume saw in perspective both their\\r\\nchildren married, and the fortunes of the Cat and Racket once more in\\r\\nskilful hands. Their satisfaction was at its height when, at dessert,\\r\\nTheodore made them a present of the wonderful picture which they had\\r\\nfailed to see, representing the interior of the old shop, and to which\\r\\nthey all owed so much happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t it pretty!\" cried Guillaume. \"And to think that any one would pay\\r\\nthirty thousand francs for that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you can see my lappets in it,\" said Madame Guillaume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the cloth unrolled!\" added Lebas; \"you might take it up in your\\r\\nhand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Drapery always comes out well,\" replied the painter. \"We should be\\r\\nonly too happy, we modern artists, if we could touch the perfection of\\r\\nantique drapery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you like drapery!\" cried old Guillaume. \"Well, then, by Gad! shake\\r\\nhands on that, my young friend. Since you can respect trade, we shall\\r\\nunderstand each other. And why should it be despised? The world began\\r\\nwith trade, since Adam sold Paradise for an apple. He did not strike\\r\\na good bargain though!\" And the old man roared with honest laughter,\\r\\nencouraged by the champagne, which he sent round with a liberal hand.\\r\\nThe band that covered the young artist\\'s eyes was so thick that he\\r\\nthought his future parents amiable. He was not above enlivening them\\r\\nby a few jests in the best taste. So he too pleased every one. In the\\r\\nevening, when the drawing-room, furnished with what Madame Guillaume\\r\\ncalled \"everything handsome,\" was deserted, and while she flitted\\r\\nfrom the table to the chimney-piece, from the candelabra to the tall\\r\\ncandlesticks, hastily blowing out the wax-lights, the worthy draper, who\\r\\nwas always clear-sighted when money was in question, called Augustine to\\r\\nhim, and seating her on his knee, spoke as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear child, you shall marry your Sommervieux since you insist; you\\r\\nmay, if you like, risk your capital in happiness. But I am not going to\\r\\nbe hoodwinked by the thirty thousand francs to be made by spoiling good\\r\\ncanvas. Money that is lightly earned is lightly spent. Did I not hear\\r\\nthat hare-brained youngster declare this evening that money was made\\r\\nround that it might roll. If it is round for spendthrifts, it is flat\\r\\nfor saving folks who pile it up. Now, my child, that fine gentleman\\r\\ntalks of giving you carriages and diamonds! He has money, let him spend\\r\\nit on you; so be it. It is no concern of mine. But as to what I can give\\r\\nyou, I will not have the crown-pieces I have picked up with so much toil\\r\\nwasted in carriages and frippery. Those who spend too fast never grow\\r\\nrich. A hundred thousand crowns, which is your fortune, will not buy\\r\\nup Paris. It is all very well to look forward to a few hundred thousand\\r\\nfrancs to be yours some day; I shall keep you waiting for them as long\\r\\nas possible, by Gad! So I took your lover aside, and a man who managed\\r\\nthe Lecocq bankruptcy had not much difficulty in persuading the artist\\r\\nto marry under a settlement of his wife\\'s money on herself. I will keep\\r\\nan eye on the marriage contract to see that what he is to settle on you\\r\\nis safely tied up. So now, my child, I hope to be a grandfather, by Gad!\\r\\nI will begin at once to lay up for my grandchildren; but swear to me,\\r\\nhere and now, never to sign any papers relating to money without my\\r\\nadvice; and if I go soon to join old Father Chevrel, promise to consult\\r\\nyoung Lebas, your brother-in-law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, father, I swear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words, spoken in a gentle voice, the old man kissed his\\r\\ndaughter on both cheeks. That night the lovers slept as soundly as\\r\\nMonsieur and Madame Guillaume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome few months after this memorable Sunday the high altar of Saint-Leu\\r\\nwas the scene of two very different weddings. Augustine and Theodore\\r\\nappeared in all the radiance of happiness, their eyes beaming with love,\\r\\ndressed with elegance, while a fine carriage waited for them. Virginie,\\r\\nwho had come in a good hired fly with the rest of the family, humbly\\r\\nfollowed her younger sister, dressed in the simplest fashion like a\\r\\nshadow necessary to the harmony of the picture. Monsieur Guillaume had\\r\\nexerted himself to the utmost in the church to get Virginie married\\r\\nbefore Augustine, but the priests, high and low, persisted in addressing\\r\\nthe more elegant of the two brides. He heard some of his neighbors\\r\\nhighly approving the good sense of Mademoiselle Virginie, who was\\r\\nmaking, as they said, the more substantial match, and remaining faithful\\r\\nto the neighborhood; while they fired a few taunts, prompted by envy of\\r\\nAugustine, who was marrying an artist and a man of rank; adding, with a\\r\\nsort of dismay, that if the Guillaumes were ambitious, there was an end\\r\\nto the business. An old fan-maker having remarked that such a prodigal\\r\\nwould soon bring his wife to beggary, father Guillaume prided himself\\r\\n_in petto_ for his prudence in the matter of marriage settlements. In\\r\\nthe evening, after a splendid ball, followed by one of those substantial\\r\\nsuppers of which the memory is dying out in the present generation,\\r\\nMonsieur and Madame Guillaume remained in a fine house belonging to them\\r\\nin the Rue du Colombier, where the wedding had been held; Monsieur\\r\\nand Madame Lebas returned in their fly to the old home in the Rue\\r\\nSaint-Denis, to steer the good ship Cat and Racket. The artist,\\r\\nintoxicated with happiness, carried off his beloved Augustine, and\\r\\neagerly lifting her out of their carriage when it reached the Rue des\\r\\nTrois-Freres, led her to an apartment embellished by all the arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fever of passion which possessed Theodore made a year fly over the\\r\\nyoung couple without a single cloud to dim the blue sky under which they\\r\\nlived. Life did not hang heavy on the lovers\\' hands. Theodore lavished\\r\\non every day inexhaustible _fioriture_ of enjoyment, and he delighted\\r\\nto vary the transports of passion by the soft languor of those hours\\r\\nof repose when souls soar so high that they seem to have forgotten all\\r\\nbodily union. Augustine was too happy for reflection; she floated on\\r\\nan undulating tide of rapture; she thought she could not do enough by\\r\\nabandoning herself to sanctioned and sacred married love; simple and\\r\\nartless, she had no coquetry, no reserves, none of the dominion which a\\r\\nworldly-minded girl acquires over her husband by ingenious caprice; she\\r\\nloved too well to calculate for the future, and never imagined that so\\r\\nexquisite a life could come to an end. Happy in being her husband\\'s sole\\r\\ndelight, she believed that her inextinguishable love would always be\\r\\nher greatest grace in his eyes, as her devotion and obedience would be\\r\\na perennial charm. And, indeed, the ecstasy of love had made her so\\r\\nbrilliantly lovely that her beauty filled her with pride, and gave her\\r\\nconfidence that she could always reign over a man so easy to kindle\\r\\nas Monsieur de Sommervieux. Thus her position as a wife brought her no\\r\\nknowledge but the lessons of love.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of her happiness, she was still the simple child who had\\r\\nlived in obscurity in the Rue Saint-Denis, and who never thought of\\r\\nacquiring the manners, the information, the tone of the world she had\\r\\nto live in. Her words being the words of love, she revealed in them, no\\r\\ndoubt, a certain pliancy of mind and a certain refinement of speech;\\r\\nbut she used the language common to all women when they find themselves\\r\\nplunged in passion, which seems to be their element. When, by chance,\\r\\nAugustine expressed an idea that did not harmonize with Theodore\\'s, the\\r\\nyoung artist laughed, as we laugh at the first mistakes of a foreigner,\\r\\nthough they end by annoying us if they are not corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of all this love-making, by the end of this year, as delightful\\r\\nas it was swift, Sommervieux felt one morning the need for resuming his\\r\\nwork and his old habits. His wife was expecting their first child. He\\r\\nsaw some friends again. During the tedious discomforts of the year when\\r\\na young wife is nursing an infant for the first time, he worked,\\r\\nno doubt, with zeal, but he occasionally sought diversion in the\\r\\nfashionable world. The house which he was best pleased to frequent\\r\\nwas that of the Duchesse de Carigliano, who had at last attracted the\\r\\ncelebrated artist to her parties. When Augustine was quite well again,\\r\\nand her boy no longer required the assiduous care which debars a mother\\r\\nfrom social pleasures, Theodore had come to the stage of wishing to know\\r\\nthe joys of satisfied vanity to be found in society by a man who shows\\r\\nhimself with a handsome woman, the object of envy and admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo figure in drawing-rooms with the reflected lustre of her husband\\'s\\r\\nfame, and to find other women envious of her, was to Augustine a new\\r\\nharvest of pleasures; but it was the last gleam of conjugal happiness.\\r\\nShe first wounded her husband\\'s vanity when, in spite of vain efforts,\\r\\nshe betrayed her ignorance, the inelegance of her language, and the\\r\\nnarrowness of her ideas. Sommervieux\\'s nature, subjugated for nearly two\\r\\nyears and a half by the first transports of love, now, in the calm of\\r\\nless new possession, recovered its bent and habits, for a while diverted\\r\\nfrom their channel. Poetry, painting, and the subtle joys of imagination\\r\\nhave inalienable rights over a lofty spirit. These cravings of a\\r\\npowerful soul had not been starved in Theodore during these two years;\\r\\nthey had only found fresh pasture. As soon as the meadows of love had\\r\\nbeen ransacked, and the artist had gathered roses and cornflowers as the\\r\\nchildren do, so greedily that he did not see that his hands could\\r\\nhold no more, the scene changed. When the painter showed his wife the\\r\\nsketches for his finest compositions he heard her exclaim, as her father\\r\\nhad done, \"How pretty!\" This tepid admiration was not the outcome of\\r\\nconscientious feeling, but of her faith on the strength of love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine cared more for a look than for the finest picture. The only\\r\\nsublime she knew was that of the heart. At last Theodore could not\\r\\nresist the evidence of the cruel fact--his wife was insensible to\\r\\npoetry, she did not dwell in his sphere, she could not follow him in\\r\\nall his vagaries, his inventions, his joys and his sorrows; she walked\\r\\ngroveling in the world of reality, while his head was in the skies.\\r\\nCommon minds cannot appreciate the perennial sufferings of a being\\r\\nwho, while bound to another by the most intimate affections, is obliged\\r\\nconstantly to suppress the dearest flights of his soul, and to thrust\\r\\ndown into the void those images which a magic power compels him to\\r\\ncreate. To him the torture is all the more intolerable because his\\r\\nfeeling towards his companion enjoins, as its first law, that they\\r\\nshould have no concealments, but mingle the aspirations of their thought\\r\\nas perfectly as the effusions of their soul. The demands of nature are\\r\\nnot to be cheated. She is as inexorable as necessity, which is, indeed,\\r\\na sort of social nature. Sommervieux took refuge in the peace and\\r\\nsilence of his studio, hoping that the habit of living with artists\\r\\nmight mould his wife and develop in her the dormant germs of lofty\\r\\nintelligence which some superior minds suppose must exist in every\\r\\nbeing. But Augustine was too sincerely religious not to take fright\\r\\nat the tone of artists. At the first dinner Theodore gave, she heard\\r\\na young painter say, with the childlike lightness, which to her was\\r\\nunintelligible, and which redeems a jest from the taint of profanity,\\r\\n\"But, madame, your Paradise cannot be more beautiful than Raphael\\'s\\r\\nTransfiguration!--Well, and I got tired of looking at that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Augustine came among this sparkling set in a spirit of distrust\\r\\nwhich no one could fail to see. She was a restraint on their freedom.\\r\\nNow an artist who feels restraint is pitiless; he stays away, or laughs\\r\\nit to scorn. Madame Guillaume, among other absurdities, had an excessive\\r\\nnotion of the dignity she considered the prerogative of a married woman;\\r\\nand Augustine, though she had often made fun of it, could not help a\\r\\nslight imitation of her mother\\'s primness. This extreme propriety, which\\r\\nvirtuous wives do not always avoid, suggested a few epigrams in the\\r\\nform of sketches, in which the harmless jest was in such good taste\\r\\nthat Sommervieux could not take offence; and even if they had been\\r\\nmore severe, these pleasantries were after all only reprisals from\\r\\nhis friends. Still, nothing could seem a trifle to a spirit so open as\\r\\nTheodore\\'s to impressions from without. A coldness insensibly crept over\\r\\nhim, and inevitably spread. To attain conjugal happiness we must climb\\r\\na hill whose summit is a narrow ridge, close to a steep and slippery\\r\\ndescent: the painter\\'s love was falling down it. He regarded his wife as\\r\\nincapable of appreciating the moral considerations which justified him\\r\\nin his own eyes for his singular behavior to her, and believed himself\\r\\nquite innocent in hiding from her thoughts she could not enter into,\\r\\nand peccadilloes outside the jurisdiction of a _bourgeois_ conscience.\\r\\nAugustine wrapped herself in sullen and silent grief. These unconfessed\\r\\nfeelings placed a shroud between the husband and wife which could not\\r\\nfail to grow thicker day by day. Though her husband never failed in\\r\\nconsideration for her, Augustine could not help trembling as she saw\\r\\nthat he kept for the outer world those treasures of wit and grace that\\r\\nhe formerly would lay at her feet. She soon began to find sinister\\r\\nmeaning in the jocular speeches that are current in the world as to the\\r\\ninconstancy of men. She made no complaints, but her demeanor conveyed\\r\\nreproach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years after her marriage this pretty young woman, who dashed past\\r\\nin her handsome carriage, and lived in a sphere of glory and riches\\r\\nto the envy of heedless folk incapable of taking a just view of the\\r\\nsituations of life, was a prey to intense grief. She lost her color; she\\r\\nreflected; she made comparisons; then sorrow unfolded to her the first\\r\\nlessons of experience. She determined to restrict herself bravely within\\r\\nthe round of duty, hoping that by this generous conduct she might\\r\\nsooner or later win back her husband\\'s love. But it was not so. When\\r\\nSommervieux, fired with work, came in from his studio, Augustine did not\\r\\nput away her work so quickly but that the painter might find his wife\\r\\nmending the household linen, and his own, with all the care of a good\\r\\nhousewife. She supplied generously and without a murmur the money needed\\r\\nfor his lavishness; but in her anxiety to husband her dear Theodore\\'s\\r\\nfortune, she was strictly economical for herself and in certain details\\r\\nof domestic management. Such conduct is incompatible with the easy-going\\r\\nhabits of artists, who, at the end of their life, have enjoyed it so\\r\\nkeenly that they never inquire into the causes of their ruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is useless to note every tint of shadow by which the brilliant hues\\r\\nof their honeymoon were overcast till they were lost in utter blackness.\\r\\nOne evening poor Augustine, who had for some time heard her husband\\r\\nspeak with enthusiasm of the Duchesse de Carigliano, received from a\\r\\nfriend certain malignantly charitable warnings as to the nature of the\\r\\nattachment which Sommervieux had formed for this celebrated flirt of\\r\\nthe Imperial Court. At one-and-twenty, in all the splendor of youth and\\r\\nbeauty, Augustine saw herself deserted for a woman of six-and-thirty.\\r\\nFeeling herself so wretched in the midst of a world of festivity which\\r\\nto her was a blank, the poor little thing could no longer understand\\r\\nthe admiration she excited, or the envy of which she was the object.\\r\\nHer face assumed a different expression. Melancholy, tinged her features\\r\\nwith the sweetness of resignation and the pallor of scorned love. Ere\\r\\nlong she too was courted by the most fascinating men; but she remained\\r\\nlonely and virtuous. Some contemptuous words which escaped her husband\\r\\nfilled her with incredible despair. A sinister flash showed her the\\r\\nbreaches which, as a result of her sordid education, hindered the\\r\\nperfect union of her soul with Theodore\\'s; she loved him well enough to\\r\\nabsolve him and condemn herself. She shed tears of blood, and perceived,\\r\\ntoo late, that there are _mesalliances_ of the spirit as well as of\\r\\nrank and habits. As she recalled the early raptures of their union,\\r\\nshe understood the full extent of that lost happiness, and accepted the\\r\\nconclusion that so rich a harvest of love was in itself a whole life,\\r\\nwhich only sorrow could pay for. At the same time, she loved too truly\\r\\nto lose all hope. At one-and-twenty she dared undertake to educate\\r\\nherself, and make her imagination, at least, worthy of that she admired.\\r\\n\"If I am not a poet,\" thought she, \"at any rate, I will understand\\r\\npoetry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, with all the strength of will, all the energy which every woman\\r\\ncan display when she loves, Madame de Sommervieux tried to alter her\\r\\ncharacter, her manners, and her habits; but by dint of devouring books\\r\\nand learning undauntedly, she only succeeded in becoming less ignorant.\\r\\nLightness of wit and the graces of conversation are a gift of nature, or\\r\\nthe fruit of education begun in the cradle. She could appreciate\\r\\nmusic and enjoy it, but she could not sing with taste. She understood\\r\\nliterature and the beauties of poetry, but it was too late to\\r\\ncultivate her refractory memory. She listened with pleasure to social\\r\\nconversation, but she could contribute nothing brilliant. Her religious\\r\\nnotions and home-grown prejudices were antagonistic to the complete\\r\\nemancipation of her intelligence. Finally, a foregone conclusion against\\r\\nher had stolen into Theodore\\'s mind, and this she could not conquer. The\\r\\nartist would laugh, at those who flattered him about his wife, and his\\r\\nirony had some foundation; he so overawed the pathetic young creature\\r\\nthat, in his presence, or alone with him, she trembled. Hampered by her\\r\\ntoo eager desire to please, her wits and her knowledge vanished in one\\r\\nabsorbing feeling. Even her fidelity vexed the unfaithful husband, who\\r\\nseemed to bid her do wrong by stigmatizing her virtue as insensibility.\\r\\nAugustine tried in vain to abdicate her reason, to yield to her\\r\\nhusband\\'s caprices and whims, to devote herself to the selfishness of\\r\\nhis vanity. Her sacrifices bore no fruit. Perhaps they had both let\\r\\nthe moment slip when souls may meet in comprehension. One day the young\\r\\nwife\\'s too sensitive heart received one of those blows which so strain\\r\\nthe bonds of feeling that they seem to be broken. She withdrew into\\r\\nsolitude. But before long a fatal idea suggested to her to seek counsel\\r\\nand comfort in the bosom of her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo one morning she made her way towards the grotesque facade of the\\r\\nhumble, silent home where she had spent her childhood. She sighed as she\\r\\nlooked up at the sash-window, whence one day she had sent her first kiss\\r\\nto him who now shed as much sorrow as glory on her life. Nothing was\\r\\nchanged in the cavern, where the drapery business had, however, started\\r\\non a new life. Augustine\\'s sister filled her mother\\'s old place at the\\r\\ndesk. The unhappy young woman met her brother-in-law with his pen behind\\r\\nhis ear; he hardly listened to her, he was so full of business. The\\r\\nformidable symptoms of stock-taking were visible all round him; he\\r\\nbegged her to excuse him. She was received coldly enough by her sister,\\r\\nwho owed her a grudge. In fact, Augustine, in her finery, and stepping\\r\\nout of a handsome carriage, had never been to see her but when passing\\r\\nby. The wife of the prudent Lebas, imagining that want of money was the\\r\\nprime cause of this early call, tried to keep up a tone of reserve which\\r\\nmore than once made Augustine smile. The painter\\'s wife perceived that,\\r\\napart from the cap and lappets, her mother had found in Virginie a\\r\\nsuccessor who could uphold the ancient honor of the Cat and Racket. At\\r\\nbreakfast she observed certain changes in the management of the house\\r\\nwhich did honor to Lebas\\' good sense; the assistants did not rise before\\r\\ndessert; they were allowed to talk, and the abundant meal spoke of ease\\r\\nwithout luxury. The fashionable woman found some tickets for a box at\\r\\nthe Francais, where she remembered having seen her sister from time to\\r\\ntime. Madame Lebas had a cashmere shawl over her shoulders, of which\\r\\nthe value bore witness to her husband\\'s generosity to her. In short, the\\r\\ncouple were keeping pace with the times. During the two-thirds of the\\r\\nday she spent there, Augustine was touched to the heart by the equable\\r\\nhappiness, devoid, to be sure, of all emotion, but equally free from\\r\\nstorms, enjoyed by this well-matched couple. They had accepted life as\\r\\na commercial enterprise, in which, above all, they must do credit to the\\r\\nbusiness. Not finding any great love in her husband, Virginie had set to\\r\\nwork to create it. Having by degrees learned to esteem and care for his\\r\\nwife, the time that his happiness had taken to germinate was to Joseph\\r\\nLebas a guarantee of its durability. Hence, when Augustine plaintively\\r\\nset forth her painful position, she had to face the deluge of\\r\\ncommonplace morality which the traditions of the Rue Saint-Denis\\r\\nfurnished to her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The mischief is done, wife,\" said Joseph Lebas; \"we must try to give\\r\\nour sister good advice.\" Then the clever tradesman ponderously analyzed\\r\\nthe resources which law and custom might offer Augustine as a means\\r\\nof escape at this crisis; he ticketed every argument, so to speak, and\\r\\narranged them in their degrees of weight under various categories, as\\r\\nthough they were articles of merchandise of different qualities; then he\\r\\nput them in the scale, weighed them, and ended by showing the necessity\\r\\nfor his sister-in-law\\'s taking violent steps which could not satisfy the\\r\\nlove she still had for her husband; and, indeed, the feeling had\\r\\nrevived in all its strength when she heard Joseph Lebas speak of\\r\\nlegal proceedings. Augustine thanked them, and returned home even more\\r\\nundecided than she had been before consulting them. She now ventured\\r\\nto go to the house in the Rue du Colombier, intending to confide her\\r\\ntroubles to her father and mother; for she was like a sick man who, in\\r\\nhis desperate plight, tries every prescription, and even puts faith in\\r\\nold wives\\' remedies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old people received their daughter with an effusiveness that touched\\r\\nher deeply. Her visit brought them some little change, and that to them\\r\\nwas worth a fortune. For the last four years they had gone their way\\r\\nlike navigators without a goal or a compass. Sitting by the chimney\\r\\ncorner, they would talk over their disasters under the old law of\\r\\n_maximum_, of their great investments in cloth, of the way they had\\r\\nweathered bankruptcies, and, above all, the famous failure of Lecocq,\\r\\nMonsieur Guillaume\\'s battle of Marengo. Then, when they had exhausted\\r\\nthe tale of lawsuits, they recapitulated the sum total of their most\\r\\nprofitable stock-takings, and told each other old stories of the\\r\\nSaint-Denis quarter. At two o\\'clock old Guillaume went to cast an eye on\\r\\nthe business at the Cat and Racket; on his way back he called at all the\\r\\nshops, formerly the rivals of his own, where the young proprietors hoped\\r\\nto inveigle the old draper into some risky discount, which, as was his\\r\\nwont, he never refused point-blank. Two good Normandy horses were dying\\r\\nof their own fat in the stables of the big house; Madame Guillaume never\\r\\nused them but to drag her on Sundays to high Mass at the parish church.\\r\\nThree times a week the worthy couple kept open house. By the influence\\r\\nof his son-in-law Sommervieux, Monsieur Guillaume had been named a\\r\\nmember of the consulting board for the clothing of the Army. Since her\\r\\nhusband had stood so high in office, Madame Guillaume had decided\\r\\nthat she must receive; her rooms were so crammed with gold and silver\\r\\nornaments, and furniture, tasteless but of undoubted value, that the\\r\\nsimplest room in the house looked like a chapel. Economy and expense\\r\\nseemed to be struggling for the upper hand in every accessory. It was as\\r\\nthough Monsieur Guillaume had looked to a good investment, even in the\\r\\npurchase of a candlestick. In the midst of this bazaar, where splendor\\r\\nrevealed the owner\\'s want of occupation, Sommervieux\\'s famous picture\\r\\nfilled the place of honor, and in it Monsieur and Madame Guillaume found\\r\\ntheir chief consolation, turning their eyes, harnessed with eye-glasses,\\r\\ntwenty times a day on this presentment of their past life, to them so\\r\\nactive and amusing. The appearance of this mansion and these rooms,\\r\\nwhere everything had an aroma of staleness and mediocrity, the spectacle\\r\\noffered by these two beings, cast away, as it were, on a rock far from\\r\\nthe world and the ideas which are life, startled Augustine; she could\\r\\nhere contemplate the sequel of the scene of which the first part had\\r\\nstruck her at the house of Lebas--a life of stir without movement, a\\r\\nmechanical and instinctive existence like that of the beaver; and then\\r\\nshe felt an indefinable pride in her troubles, as she reflected that\\r\\nthey had their source in eighteen months of such happiness as, in her\\r\\neyes, was worth a thousand lives like this; its vacuity seemed to her\\r\\nhorrible. However, she concealed this not very charitable feeling, and\\r\\ndisplayed for her parents her newly-acquired accomplishments of mind,\\r\\nand the ingratiating tenderness that love had revealed to her, disposing\\r\\nthem to listen to her matrimonial grievances. Old people have a weakness\\r\\nfor this kind of confidence. Madame Guillaume wanted to know the most\\r\\ntrivial details of that alien life, which to her seemed almost fabulous.\\r\\nThe travels of Baron da la Houtan, which she began again and again and\\r\\nnever finished, told her nothing more unheard-of concerning the Canadian\\r\\nsavages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, child, your husband shuts himself into a room with naked women!\\r\\nAnd you are so simple as to believe that he draws them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she uttered this exclamation, the grandmother laid her spectacles\\r\\non a little work-table, shook her skirts, and clasped her hands on her\\r\\nknees, raised by a foot-warmer, her favorite pedestal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, mother, all artists are obliged to have models.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He took good care not to tell us that when he asked leave to marry\\r\\nyou. If I had known it, I would never had given my daughter to a man who\\r\\nfollowed such a trade. Religion forbids such horrors; they are immoral.\\r\\nAnd at what time of night do you say he comes home?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At one o\\'clock--two----\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old folks looked at each other in utter amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then he gambles?\" said Monsieur Guillaume. \"In my day only gamblers\\r\\nstayed out so late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine made a face that scorned the accusation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must keep you up through dreadful nights waiting for him,\" said\\r\\nMadame Guillaume. \"But you go to bed, don\\'t you? And when he has lost,\\r\\nthe wretch wakes you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, mamma, on the contrary, he is sometimes in very good spirits. Not\\r\\nunfrequently, indeed, when it is fine, he suggests that I should get up\\r\\nand go into the woods.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The woods! At that hour? Then have you such a small set of rooms that\\r\\nhis bedroom and his sitting-room are not enough, and that he must run\\r\\nabout? But it is just to give you cold that the wretch proposes such\\r\\nexpeditions. He wants to get rid of you. Did one ever hear of a man\\r\\nsettled in life, a well-behaved, quiet man galloping about like a\\r\\nwarlock?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear mother, you do not understand that he must have excitement\\r\\nto fire his genius. He is fond of scenes which----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would make scenes for him, fine scenes!\" cried Madame Guillaume,\\r\\ninterrupting her daughter. \"How can you show any consideration to such a\\r\\nman? In the first place, I don\\'t like his drinking water only; it is not\\r\\nwholesome. Why does he object to see a woman eating? What queer notion\\r\\nis that! But he is mad. All you tell us about him is impossible. A man\\r\\ncannot leave his home without a word, and never come back for ten days.\\r\\nAnd then he tells you he has been to Dieppe to paint the sea. As if\\r\\nany one painted the sea! He crams you with a pack of tales that are too\\r\\nabsurd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine opened her lips to defend her husband; but Madame Guillaume\\r\\nenjoined silence with a wave of her hand, which she obeyed by a survival\\r\\nof habit, and her mother went on in harsh tones: \"Don\\'t talk to me about\\r\\nthe man! He never set foot in church excepting to see you and to be\\r\\nmarried. People without religion are capable of anything. Did Guillaume\\r\\never dream of hiding anything from me, of spending three days without\\r\\nsaying a word to me, and of chattering afterwards like a blind magpie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear mother, you judge superior people too severely. If their ideas\\r\\nwere the same as other folks\\', they would not be men of genius.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, then let men of genius stop at home and not get married.\\r\\nWhat! A man of genius is to make his wife miserable? And because he is a\\r\\ngenius it is all right! Genius, genius! It is not so very clever to\\r\\nsay black one minute and white the next, as he does, to interrupt other\\r\\npeople, to dance such rigs at home, never to let you know which foot you\\r\\nare to stand on, to compel his wife never to be amused unless my lord is\\r\\nin gay spirits, and to be dull when he is dull.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, mother, the very nature of such imaginations----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are such \\'imaginations\\'?\" Madame Guillaume went on, interrupting\\r\\nher daughter again. \"Fine ones his are, my word! What possesses a man\\r\\nthat all on a sudden, without consulting a doctor, he takes it into his\\r\\nhead to eat nothing but vegetables? If indeed it were from religious\\r\\nmotives, it might do him some good--but he has no more religion than a\\r\\nHuguenot. Was there ever a man known who, like him, loved horses better\\r\\nthan his fellow-creatures, had his hair curled like a heathen, laid\\r\\nstatues under muslin coverlets, shut his shutters in broad day to work\\r\\nby lamp-light? There, get along; if he were not so grossly immoral, he\\r\\nwould be fit to shut up in a lunatic asylum. Consult Monsieur Loraux,\\r\\nthe priest at Saint Sulpice, ask his opinion about it all, and he will\\r\\ntell you that your husband, does not behave like a Christian.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, mother, can you believe----?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do believe. You loved him, and you can see none of these things.\\r\\nBut I can remember in the early days after your marriage. I met him\\r\\nin the Champs-Elysees. He was on horseback. Well, at one minute he was\\r\\ngalloping as hard as he could tear, and then pulled up to a walk. I said\\r\\nto myself at that moment, \\'There is a man devoid of judgement.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, ha!\" cried Monsieur Guillaume, \"how wise I was to have your money\\r\\nsettled on yourself with such a queer fellow for a husband!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Augustine was so imprudent as to set forth her serious grievances\\r\\nagainst her husband, the two old people were speechless with\\r\\nindignation. But the word \"divorce\" was ere long spoken by Madame\\r\\nGuillaume. At the sound of the word divorce the apathetic old draper\\r\\nseemed to wake up. Prompted by his love for his daughter, and also by\\r\\nthe excitement which the proceedings would bring into his uneventful\\r\\nlife, father Guillaume took up the matter. He made himself the leader of\\r\\nthe application for a divorce, laid down the lines of it, almost argued\\r\\nthe case; he offered to be at all the charges, to see the lawyers, the\\r\\npleaders, the judges, to move heaven and earth. Madame de Sommervieux\\r\\nwas frightened, she refused her father\\'s services, said she would not\\r\\nbe separated from her husband even if she were ten times as unhappy, and\\r\\ntalked no more about her sorrows. After being overwhelmed by her parents\\r\\nwith all the little wordless and consoling kindnesses by which the\\r\\nold couple tried in vain to make up to her for her distress of heart,\\r\\nAugustine went away, feeling the impossibility of making a superior mind\\r\\nintelligible to weak intellects. She had learned that a wife must hide\\r\\nfrom every one, even from her parents, woes for which it is so difficult\\r\\nto find sympathy. The storms and sufferings of the upper spheres\\r\\nare appreciated only by the lofty spirits who inhabit there. In any\\r\\ncircumstance we can only be judged by our equals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus poor Augustine found herself thrown back on the horror of her\\r\\nmeditations, in the cold atmosphere of her home. Study was indifferent\\r\\nto her, since study had not brought her back her husband\\'s heart.\\r\\nInitiated into the secret of these souls of fire, but bereft of their\\r\\nresources, she was compelled to share their sorrows without sharing\\r\\ntheir pleasures. She was disgusted with the world, which to her seemed\\r\\nmean and small as compared with the incidents of passion. In short, her\\r\\nlife was a failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening an idea flashed upon her that lighted up her dark grief like\\r\\na beam from heaven. Such an idea could never have smiled on a heart less\\r\\npure, less virtuous than hers. She determined to go to the Duchesse de\\r\\nCarigliano, not to ask her to give her back her husband\\'s heart, but to\\r\\nlearn the arts by which it had been captured; to engage the interest of\\r\\nthis haughty fine lady for the mother of her lover\\'s children; to appeal\\r\\nto her and make her the instrument of her future happiness, since she\\r\\nwas the cause of her present wretchedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo one day Augustine, timid as she was, but armed with supernatural\\r\\ncourage, got into her carriage at two in the afternoon to try for\\r\\nadmittance to the boudoir of the famous coquette, who was never visible\\r\\ntill that hour. Madame de Sommervieux had not yet seen any of the\\r\\nancient and magnificent mansions of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. As she\\r\\nmade her way through the stately corridors, the handsome staircases,\\r\\nthe vast drawing-rooms--full of flowers, though it was in the depth of\\r\\nwinter, and decorated with the taste peculiar to women born to opulence\\r\\nor to the elegant habits of the aristocracy, Augustine felt a terrible\\r\\nclutch at her heart; she coveted the secrets of an elegance of which\\r\\nshe had never had an idea; she breathed in an air of grandeur which\\r\\nexplained the attraction of the house for her husband. When she reached\\r\\nthe private rooms of the Duchess she was filled with jealousy and a sort\\r\\nof despair, as she admired the luxurious arrangement of the furniture,\\r\\nthe draperies and the hangings. Here disorder was a grace, here luxury\\r\\naffected a certain contempt of splendor. The fragrance that floated\\r\\nin the warm air flattered the sense of smell without offending it.\\r\\nThe accessories of the rooms were in harmony with a view, through\\r\\nplate-glass windows, of the lawns in a garden planted with evergreen\\r\\ntrees. It was all bewitching, and the art of it was not perceptible. The\\r\\nwhole spirit of the mistress of these rooms pervaded the drawing-room\\r\\nwhere Augustine awaited her. She tried to divine her rival\\'s character\\r\\nfrom the aspect of the scattered objects; but there was here something\\r\\nas impenetrable in the disorder as in the symmetry, and to the\\r\\nsimple-minded young wife all was a sealed letter. All that she could\\r\\ndiscern was that, as a woman, the Duchess was a superior person. Then a\\r\\npainful thought came over her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alas! And is it true,\" she wondered, \"that a simple and loving heart\\r\\nis not all-sufficient to an artist; that to balance the weight of these\\r\\npowerful souls they need a union with feminine souls of a strength equal\\r\\nto their own? If I had been brought up like this siren, our weapons at\\r\\nleast might have been equal in the hour of struggle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I am not at home!\" The sharp, harsh words, though spoken in an\\r\\nundertone in the adjoining boudoir, were heard by Augustine, and her\\r\\nheart beat violently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The lady is in there,\" replied the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are an idiot! Show her in,\" replied the Duchess, whose voice was\\r\\nsweeter, and had assumed the dulcet tones of politeness. She evidently\\r\\nnow meant to be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine shyly entered the room. At the end of the dainty boudoir she\\r\\nsaw the Duchess lounging luxuriously on an ottoman covered with brown\\r\\nvelvet and placed in the centre of a sort of apse outlined by soft folds\\r\\nof white muslin over a yellow lining. Ornaments of gilt bronze, arranged\\r\\nwith exquisite taste, enhanced this sort of dais, under which the\\r\\nDuchess reclined like a Greek statue. The dark hue of the velvet gave\\r\\nrelief to every fascinating charm. A subdued light, friendly to her\\r\\nbeauty, fell like a reflection rather than a direct illumination. A few\\r\\nrare flowers raised their perfumed heads from costly Sevres vases. At\\r\\nthe moment when this picture was presented to Augustine\\'s astonished\\r\\neyes, she was approaching so noiselessly that she caught a glance from\\r\\nthose of the enchantress. This look seemed to say to some one whom\\r\\nAugustine did not at first perceive, \"Stay; you will see a pretty woman,\\r\\nand make her visit seem less of a bore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn seeing Augustine, the Duchess rose and made her sit down by her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, madame?\" she said with\\r\\na most gracious smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why all the falseness?\" thought Augustine, replying only with a bow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer silence was compulsory. The young woman saw before her a superfluous\\r\\nwitness of the scene. This personage was, of all the Colonels in the\\r\\narmy, the youngest, the most fashionable, and the finest man. His face,\\r\\nfull of life and youth, but already expressive, was further enhanced by\\r\\na small moustache twirled up into points, and as black as jet, by a full\\r\\nimperial, by whiskers carefully combed, and a forest of black hair in\\r\\nsome disorder. He was whisking a riding whip with an air of ease and\\r\\nfreedom which suited his self-satisfied expression and the elegance of\\r\\nhis dress; the ribbons attached to his button-hole were carelessly tied,\\r\\nand he seemed to pride himself much more on his smart appearance than\\r\\non his courage. Augustine looked at the Duchesse de Carigliano, and\\r\\nindicated the Colonel by a sidelong glance. All its mute appeal was\\r\\nunderstood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-bye, then, Monsieur d\\'Aiglemont, we shall meet in the Bois de\\r\\nBoulogne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words were spoken by the siren as though they were the result of\\r\\nan agreement made before Augustine\\'s arrival, and she winged them with a\\r\\nthreatening look that the officer deserved perhaps for the admiration he\\r\\nshowed in gazing at the modest flower, which contrasted so well with the\\r\\nhaughty Duchess. The young fop bowed in silence, turned on the heels\\r\\nof his boots, and gracefully quitted the boudoir. At this instant,\\r\\nAugustine, watching her rival, whose eyes seemed to follow the brilliant\\r\\nofficer, detected in that glance a sentiment of which the transient\\r\\nexpression is known to every woman. She perceived with the deepest\\r\\nanguish that her visit would be useless; this lady, full of artifice,\\r\\nwas too greedy of homage not to have a ruthless heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madame,\" said Augustine in a broken voice, \"the step I am about to take\\r\\nwill seem to you very strange; but there is a madness of despair which\\r\\nought to excuse anything. I understand only too well why Theodore\\r\\nprefers your house to any other, and why your mind has so much power\\r\\nover his. Alas! I have only to look into myself to find more than ample\\r\\nreasons. But I am devoted to my husband, madame. Two years of tears have\\r\\nnot effaced his image from my heart, though I have lost his. In my folly\\r\\nI dared to dream of a contest with you; and I have come to you to ask\\r\\nyou by what means I may triumph over yourself. Oh, madame,\" cried the\\r\\nyoung wife, ardently seizing the hand which her rival allowed her to\\r\\nhold, \"I will never pray to God for my own happiness with so much\\r\\nfervor as I will beseech Him for yours, if you will help me to win back\\r\\nSommervieux\\'s regard--I will not say his love. I have no hope but in\\r\\nyou. Ah! tell me how you could please him, and make him forget the first\\r\\ndays----\" At these words Augustine broke down, suffocated with sobs she\\r\\ncould not suppress. Ashamed of her weakness, she hid her face in her\\r\\nhandkerchief, which she bathed with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a child you are, my dear little beauty!\" said the Duchess, carried\\r\\naway by the novelty of such a scene, and touched, in spite of herself,\\r\\nat receiving such homage from the most perfect virtue perhaps in Paris.\\r\\nShe took the young wife\\'s handkerchief, and herself wiped the tears from\\r\\nher eyes, soothing her by a few monosyllables murmured with gracious\\r\\ncompassion. After a moment\\'s silence the Duchess, grasping poor\\r\\nAugustine\\'s hands in both her own--hands that had a rare character of\\r\\ndignity and powerful beauty--said in a gentle and friendly voice:\\r\\n\"My first warning is to advise you not to weep so bitterly; tears are\\r\\ndisfiguring. We must learn to deal firmly with the sorrows that make us\\r\\nill, for love does not linger long by a sick-bed. Melancholy, at first,\\r\\nno doubt, lends a certain attractive grace, but it ends by dragging the\\r\\nfeatures and blighting the loveliest face. And besides, our tyrants are\\r\\nso vain as to insist that their slaves should be always cheerful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, madame, it is not in my power not to feel. How is it possible,\\r\\nwithout suffering a thousand deaths, to see the face which once beamed\\r\\nwith love and gladness turn chill, colorless, and indifferent? I cannot\\r\\ncontrol my heart!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the worse, sweet child. But I fancy I know all your story.\\r\\nIn the first place, if your husband is unfaithful to you, understand\\r\\nclearly that I am not his accomplice. If I was anxious to have him in my\\r\\ndrawing-room, it was, I own, out of vanity; he was famous, and he went\\r\\nnowhere. I like you too much already to tell you all the mad things he\\r\\nhas done for my sake. I will only reveal one, because it may perhaps\\r\\nhelp us to bring him back to you, and to punish him for the audacity of\\r\\nhis behavior to me. He will end by compromising me. I know the world\\r\\ntoo well, my dear, to abandon myself to the discretion of a too superior\\r\\nman. You should know that one may allow them to court one, but marry\\r\\nthem--that is a mistake! We women ought to admire men of genius, and\\r\\ndelight in them as a spectacle, but as to living with them? Never.--No,\\r\\nno. It is like wanting to find pleasure in inspecting the machinery of\\r\\nthe opera instead of sitting in a box to enjoy its brilliant illusions.\\r\\nBut this misfortune has fallen on you, my poor child, has it not? Well,\\r\\nthen, you must try to arm yourself against tyranny.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, madame, before coming in here, only seeing you as I came in, I\\r\\nalready detected some arts of which I had no suspicion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, come and see me sometimes, and it will not be long before you\\r\\nhave mastered the knowledge of these trifles, important, too, in their\\r\\nway. Outward things are, to fools, half of life; and in that matter more\\r\\nthan one clever man is a fool, in spite of all his talent. But I dare\\r\\nwager you never could refuse your Theodore anything!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How refuse anything, madame, if one loves a man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor innocent, I could adore you for your simplicity. You should know\\r\\nthat the more we love the less we should allow a man, above all, a\\r\\nhusband, to see the whole extent of our passion. The one who loves most\\r\\nis tyrannized over, and, which is worse, is sooner or later neglected.\\r\\nThe one who wishes to rule should----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, madame, must I then dissimulate, calculate, become false, form an\\r\\nartificial character, and live in it? How is it possible to live in such\\r\\na way? Can you----\" she hesitated; the Duchess smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear child,\" the great lady went on in a serious tone, \"conjugal\\r\\nhappiness has in all times been a speculation, a business demanding\\r\\nparticular attention. If you persist in talking passion while I am\\r\\ntalking marriage, we shall soon cease to understand each other. Listen\\r\\nto me,\" she went on, assuming a confidential tone. \"I have been in\\r\\nthe way of seeing some of the superior men of our day. Those who have\\r\\nmarried have for the most part chosen quite insignificant wives. Well,\\r\\nthose wives governed them, as the Emperor governs us; and if they were\\r\\nnot loved, they were at least respected. I like secrets--especially\\r\\nthose which concern women--well enough to have amused myself by seeking\\r\\nthe clue to the riddle. Well, my sweet child, those worthy women had the\\r\\ngift of analyzing their husbands\\' nature; instead of taking fright, like\\r\\nyou, at their superiority, they very acutely noted the qualities they\\r\\nlacked, and either by possessing those qualities, or by feigning to\\r\\npossess them, they found means of making such a handsome display of them\\r\\nin their husbands\\' eyes that in the end they impressed them. Also, I\\r\\nmust tell you, all these souls which appear so lofty have just a speck\\r\\nof madness in them, which we ought to know how to take advantage of. By\\r\\nfirmly resolving to have the upper hand and never deviating from that\\r\\naim, by bringing all our actions to bear on it, all our ideas, our\\r\\ncajolery, we subjugate these eminently capricious natures, which, by\\r\\nthe very mutability of their thoughts, lend us the means of influencing\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried the young wife in dismay. \"And this is life. It is\\r\\na warfare----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In which we must always threaten,\" said the Duchess, laughing. \"Our\\r\\npower is wholly factitious. And we must never allow a man to despise\\r\\nus; it is impossible to recover from such a descent but by odious\\r\\nmanoeuvring. Come,\" she added, \"I will give you a means of bringing your\\r\\nhusband to his senses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose with a smile to guide the young and guileless apprentice\\r\\nto conjugal arts through the labyrinth of her palace. They came to\\r\\na back-staircase, which led up to the reception rooms. As Madame de\\r\\nCarigliano pressed the secret springlock of the door she stopped,\\r\\nlooking at Augustine with an inimitable gleam of shrewdness and grace.\\r\\n\"The Duc de Carigliano adores me,\" said she. \"Well, he dare not enter by\\r\\nthis door without my leave. And he is a man in the habit of commanding\\r\\nthousands of soldiers. He knows how to face a battery, but before\\r\\nme,--he is afraid!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine sighed. They entered a sumptuous gallery, where the painter\\'s\\r\\nwife was led by the Duchess up to the portrait painted by Theodore of\\r\\nMademoiselle Guillaume. On seeing it, Augustine uttered a cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew it was no longer in my house,\" she said, \"but--here!----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear child, I asked for it merely to see what pitch of idiocy a man\\r\\nof genius may attain to. Sooner or later I should have returned it to\\r\\nyou, for I never expected the pleasure of seeing the original here face\\r\\nto face with the copy. While we finish our conversation I will have it\\r\\ncarried down to your carriage. And if, armed with such a talisman,\\r\\nyou are not your husband\\'s mistress for a hundred years, you are not a\\r\\nwoman, and you deserve your fate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine kissed the Duchess\\' hand, and the lady clasped her to her\\r\\nheart, with all the more tenderness because she would forget her by the\\r\\nmorrow. This scene might perhaps have destroyed for ever the candor and\\r\\npurity of a less virtuous woman than Augustine, for the astute politics\\r\\nof the higher social spheres were no more consonant to Augustine than\\r\\nthe narrow reasoning of Joseph Lebas, or Madame Guillaume\\'s vapid\\r\\nmorality. Strange are the results of the false positions into which\\r\\nwe may be brought by the slightest mistake in the conduct of life!\\r\\nAugustine was like an Alpine cowherd surprised by an avalanche; if he\\r\\nhesitates, if he listens to the shouts of his comrades, he is almost\\r\\ncertainly lost. In such a crisis the heart steels itself or breaks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame de Sommervieux returned home a prey to such agitation as it is\\r\\ndifficult to describe. Her conversation with the Duchesse de Carigliano\\r\\nhad roused in her mind a crowd of contradictory thoughts. Like the sheep\\r\\nin the fable, full of courage in the wolf\\'s absence, she preached\\r\\nto herself, and laid down admirable plans of conduct; she devised a\\r\\nthousand coquettish stratagems; she even talked to her husband, finding,\\r\\naway from him, all the springs of true eloquence which never desert a\\r\\nwoman; then, as she pictured to herself Theodore\\'s clear and steadfast\\r\\ngaze, she began to quake. When she asked whether monsieur were at home\\r\\nher voice shook. On learning that he would not be in to dinner, she felt\\r\\nan unaccountable thrill of joy. Like a criminal who has appealed against\\r\\nsentence of death, a respite, however short, seemed to her a lifetime.\\r\\nShe placed the portrait in her room, and waited for her husband in all\\r\\nthe agonies of hope. That this venture must decide her future life, she\\r\\nfelt too keenly not to shiver at every sound, even the low ticking of\\r\\nthe clock, which seemed to aggravate her terrors by doling them out to\\r\\nher. She tried to cheat time by various devices. The idea struck her of\\r\\ndressing in a way which would make her exactly like the portrait. Then,\\r\\nknowing her husband\\'s restless temper, she had her room lighted up with\\r\\nunusual brightness, feeling sure that when he came in curiosity would\\r\\nbring him there at once. Midnight had struck when, at the call of the\\r\\ngroom, the street gate was opened, and the artist\\'s carriage rumbled in\\r\\nover the stones of the silent courtyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the meaning of this illumination?\" asked Theodore in glad\\r\\ntones, as he came into her room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine skilfully seized the auspicious moment; she threw herself into\\r\\nher husband\\'s arms, and pointed to the portrait. The artist stood rigid\\r\\nas a rock, and his eyes turned alternately on Augustine, on the accusing\\r\\ndress. The frightened wife, half-dead, as she watched her husband\\'s\\r\\nchangeful brow--that terrible brow--saw the expressive furrows gathering\\r\\nlike clouds; then she felt her blood curdling in her veins when, with a\\r\\nglaring look, and in a deep hollow voice, he began to question her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where did you find that picture?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Duchess de Carigliano returned it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You asked her for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know that she had it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleness, or rather the exquisite sweetness of this angel\\'s voice,\\r\\nmight have touched a cannibal, but not an artist in the clutches of\\r\\nwounded vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is worthy of her!\" exclaimed the painter in a voice of thunder. \"I\\r\\nwill be avenged!\" he cried, striding up and down the room. \"She shall\\r\\ndie of shame; I will paint her! Yes, I will paint her as Messalina\\r\\nstealing out at night from the palace of Claudius.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Theodore!\" said a faint voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will kill her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is in love with that little cavalry colonel, because he rides\\r\\nwell----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Theodore!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me be!\" said the painter in a tone almost like a roar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be odious to describe the whole scene. In the end the frenzy\\r\\nof passion prompted the artist to acts and words which any woman not so\\r\\nyoung as Augustine would have ascribed to madness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt eight o\\'clock next morning Madame Guillaume, surprising her\\r\\ndaughter, found her pale, with red eyes, her hair in disorder, holding a\\r\\nhandkerchief soaked with tears, while she gazed at the floor strewn with\\r\\nthe torn fragments of a dress and the broken fragments of a large gilt\\r\\npicture-frame. Augustine, almost senseless with grief, pointed to the\\r\\nwreck with a gesture of deep despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know that the loss is very great!\" cried the old mistress of\\r\\nthe Cat and Racket. \"It was like you, no doubt; but I am told that there\\r\\nis a man on the boulevard who paints lovely portraits for fifty crowns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, mother!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor child, you are quite right,\" replied Madame Guillaume, who\\r\\nmisinterpreted the expression of her daughter\\'s glance at her. \"True,\\r\\nmy child, no one ever can love you as fondly as a mother. My darling,\\r\\nI guess it all; but confide your sorrows to me, and I will comfort you.\\r\\nDid I not tell you long ago that the man was mad! Your maid has told me\\r\\npretty stories. Why, he must be a perfect monster!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine laid a finger on her white lips, as if to implore a moment\\'s\\r\\nsilence. During this dreadful night misery had led her to that patient\\r\\nresignation which in mothers and loving wives transcends in its\\r\\neffects all human energy, and perhaps reveals in the heart of women the\\r\\nexistence of certain chords which God has withheld from men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn inscription engraved on a broken column in the cemetery at Montmartre\\r\\nstates that Madame de Sommervieux died at the age of twenty-seven. In\\r\\nthe simple words of this epitaph one of the timid creature\\'s friends can\\r\\nread the last scene of a tragedy. Every year, on the second of November,\\r\\nthe solemn day of the dead, he never passes this youthful monument\\r\\nwithout wondering whether it does not need a stronger woman than\\r\\nAugustine to endure the violent embrace of genius?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The humble and modest flowers that bloom in the valley,\" he reflects,\\r\\n\"perish perhaps when they are transplanted too near the skies, to the\\r\\nregion where storms gather and the sun is scorching.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nADDENDUM\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Aiglemont, General, Marquis Victor d\\'\\r\\n       The Firm of Nucingen\\r\\n       A Woman of Thirty\\r\\n\\r\\n     Birotteau, Cesar\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n       A Bachelor\\'s Establishment\\r\\n\\r\\n     Camusot\\r\\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\\r\\n       A Bachelor\\'s Establishment\\r\\n       Cousin Pons\\r\\n       The Muse of the Department\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n\\r\\n     Cardot, Jean-Jerome-Severin\\r\\n       A Start in Life\\r\\n       Lost Illusions\\r\\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\\r\\n       A Bachelor\\'s Establishment\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n\\r\\n     Carigliano, Marechal, Duc de\\r\\n       Father Goriot\\r\\n       Sarrasine\\r\\n\\r\\n     Carigliano, Duchesse de\\r\\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\\r\\n       The Peasantry\\r\\n       The Member for Arcis\\r\\n\\r\\n     Guillaume\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n\\r\\n     Lebas, Joseph\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n       Cousin Betty\\r\\n\\r\\n     Lebas, Madame Joseph (Virginie)\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n       Cousin Betty\\r\\n\\r\\n     Lourdois\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n\\r\\n     Rabourdin, Xavier\\r\\n       The Government Clerks\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n       The Middle Classes\\r\\n\\r\\n     Roguin, Madame\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n       Pierrette\\r\\n       A Second Home\\r\\n       A Daughter of Eve\\r\\n\\r\\n     Sommervieux, Theodore de\\r\\n       The Government Clerks\\r\\n       Modeste Mignon\\r\\n\\r\\n     Sommervieux, Madame Theodore de (Augustine)\\r\\n       At the Sign of the Cat and Racket\\r\\n       Cesar Birotteau\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of At the Sign of the Cat and Racket, by \\r\\nHonore de Balzac\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AT THE SIGN OF THE CAT AND RACKET ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 1680.txt or 1680.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/8/1680/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by John Bickers, and Dagny\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\r\\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\r\\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\\r\\nwith this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\\r\\npromotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\\r\\nharmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\\r\\nthat arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\\r\\nor cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nwork, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\r\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\r\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"

A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA\\r\\n\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard\\r\\nhim mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses\\r\\nand predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt\\r\\nany emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that\\r\\none particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but\\r\\nadmirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect\\r\\nreasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a\\r\\nlover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never\\r\\nspoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They\\r\\nwere admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the\\r\\nveil from men\\'s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner\\r\\nto admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\\r\\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which\\r\\nmight throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a\\r\\nsensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power\\r\\nlenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\\r\\nnature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and\\r\\nthat woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable\\r\\nmemory.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us\\r\\naway from each other. My own complete happiness, and the\\r\\nhome-centred interests which rise up around the man who first\\r\\nfinds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to\\r\\nabsorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\\r\\nsociety with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in\\r\\nBaker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from\\r\\nweek to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the\\r\\ndrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,\\r\\nas ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his\\r\\nimmense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\\r\\nfollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which\\r\\nhad been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time\\r\\nto time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons\\r\\nto Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\r\\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,\\r\\nand finally of the mission which he had accomplished so\\r\\ndelicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.\\r\\nBeyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely\\r\\nshared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of\\r\\nmy former friend and companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was\\r\\nreturning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to\\r\\ncivil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I\\r\\npassed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated\\r\\nin my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the\\r\\nStudy in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes\\r\\nagain, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.\\r\\nHis rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw\\r\\nhis tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against\\r\\nthe blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head\\r\\nsunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\\r\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their\\r\\nown story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his\\r\\ndrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new\\r\\nproblem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which\\r\\nhad formerly been in part my own.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I\\r\\nthink, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly\\r\\neye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,\\r\\nand indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he\\r\\nstood before the fire and looked me over in his singular\\r\\nintrospective fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have\\r\\nput on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seven!\" I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,\\r\\nI fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not\\r\\ntell me that you intended to go into harness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, how do you know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\\r\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and\\r\\ncareless servant girl?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too much. You would certainly\\r\\nhave been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true\\r\\nthat I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful\\r\\nmess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\\'t imagine how you\\r\\ndeduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has\\r\\ngiven her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on the\\r\\ninside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,\\r\\nthe leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they\\r\\nhave been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round\\r\\nthe edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.\\r\\nHence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile\\r\\nweather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting\\r\\nspecimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a\\r\\ngentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black\\r\\nmark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge\\r\\non the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted\\r\\nhis stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce\\r\\nhim to be an active member of the medical profession.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\r\\nprocess of deduction. \"When I hear you give your reasons,\" I\\r\\nremarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously\\r\\nsimple that I could easily do it myself, though at each\\r\\nsuccessive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you\\r\\nexplain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good\\r\\nas yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing\\r\\nhimself down into an armchair. \"You see, but you do not observe.\\r\\nThe distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen\\r\\nthe steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Frequently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How often?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, some hundreds of times.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then how many are there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many? I don\\'t know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is\\r\\njust my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,\\r\\nbecause I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are\\r\\ninterested in these little problems, and since you are good\\r\\nenough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you\\r\\nmay be interested in this.\" He threw over a sheet of thick,\\r\\npink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.\\r\\n\"It came by the last post,\" said he. \"Read it aloud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight\\r\\no\\'clock,\" it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a\\r\\nmatter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of\\r\\nthe royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may\\r\\nsafely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which\\r\\ncan hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all\\r\\nquarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do\\r\\nnot take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is indeed a mystery,\" I remarked. \"What do you imagine that\\r\\nit means?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before\\r\\none has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit\\r\\ntheories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.\\r\\nWhat do you deduce from it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\r\\nwritten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked,\\r\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion\\'s processes. \"Such paper\\r\\ncould not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly\\r\\nstrong and stiff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Peculiar--that is the very word,\" said Holmes. \"It is not an\\r\\nEnglish paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI did so, and saw a large \"E\" with a small \"g,\" a \"P,\" and a\\r\\nlarge \"G\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you make of that?\" asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all. The \\'G\\' with the small \\'t\\' stands for\\r\\n\\'Gesellschaft,\\' which is the German for \\'Company.\\' It is a\\r\\ncustomary contraction like our \\'Co.\\' \\'P,\\' of course, stands for\\r\\n\\'Papier.\\' Now for the \\'Eg.\\' Let us glance at our Continental\\r\\nGazetteer.\" He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.\\r\\n\"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking\\r\\ncountry--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \\'Remarkable as being\\r\\nthe scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\\r\\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\\' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you\\r\\nmake of that?\" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue\\r\\ntriumphant cloud from his cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The paper was made in Bohemia,\" I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you\\r\\nnote the peculiar construction of the sentence--\\'This account of\\r\\nyou we have from all quarters received.\\' A Frenchman or Russian\\r\\ncould not have written that. It is the German who is so\\r\\nuncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover\\r\\nwhat is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and\\r\\nprefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if\\r\\nI am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\\' hoofs and\\r\\ngrating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the\\r\\nbell. Holmes whistled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A pair, by the sound,\" said he. \"Yes,\" he continued, glancing\\r\\nout of the window. \"A nice little brougham and a pair of\\r\\nbeauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\\'s money in\\r\\nthis case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that I had better go, Holmes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my\\r\\nBoswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity\\r\\nto miss it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But your client--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he\\r\\ncomes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best\\r\\nattention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and\\r\\nin the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there\\r\\nwas a loud and authoritative tap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in!\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six\\r\\ninches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His\\r\\ndress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked\\r\\nupon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed\\r\\nacross the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while\\r\\nthe deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined\\r\\nwith flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch\\r\\nwhich consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended\\r\\nhalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with\\r\\nrich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence\\r\\nwhich was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a\\r\\nbroad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\r\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black\\r\\nvizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,\\r\\nfor his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower\\r\\npart of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,\\r\\nwith a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive\\r\\nof resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You had my note?\" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a\\r\\nstrongly marked German accent. \"I told you that I would call.\" He\\r\\nlooked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to\\r\\naddress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray take a seat,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend and\\r\\ncolleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me\\r\\nin my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.\\r\\nI understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour\\r\\nand discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most\\r\\nextreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate\\r\\nwith you alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me\\r\\nback into my chair. \"It is both, or none,\" said he. \"You may say\\r\\nbefore this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \"Then I must begin,\" said\\r\\nhe, \"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at\\r\\nthe end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At\\r\\npresent it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it\\r\\nmay have an influence upon European history.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I promise,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will excuse this mask,\" continued our strange visitor. \"The\\r\\naugust person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to\\r\\nyou, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have\\r\\njust called myself is not exactly my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was aware of it,\" said Holmes dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution\\r\\nhas to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense\\r\\nscandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of\\r\\nEurope. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House\\r\\nof Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was also aware of that,\" murmured Holmes, settling himself\\r\\ndown in his armchair and closing his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\r\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him\\r\\nas the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.\\r\\nHolmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his\\r\\ngigantic client.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\" he\\r\\nremarked, \"I should be better able to advise you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\r\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he\\r\\ntore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \"You\\r\\nare right,\" he cried; \"I am the King. Why should I attempt to\\r\\nconceal it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, indeed?\" murmured Holmes. \"Your Majesty had not spoken\\r\\nbefore I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich\\r\\nSigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and\\r\\nhereditary King of Bohemia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down\\r\\nonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you\\r\\ncan understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in\\r\\nmy own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not\\r\\nconfide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I\\r\\nhave come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, pray consult,\" said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a\\r\\nlengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known\\r\\nadventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\" murmured Holmes without\\r\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of\\r\\ndocketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it\\r\\nwas difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not\\r\\nat once furnish information. In this case I found her biography\\r\\nsandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a\\r\\nstaff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea\\r\\nfishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me see!\" said Holmes. \"Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year\\r\\n1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera\\r\\nof Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in\\r\\nLondon--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled\\r\\nwith this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and\\r\\nis now desirous of getting those letters back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely so. But how--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there a secret marriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No legal papers or certificates?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\\r\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is\\r\\nshe to prove their authenticity?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is the writing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My private note-paper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stolen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My own seal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Imitated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My photograph.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bought.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were both in the photograph.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\r\\nindiscretion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was mad--insane.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have compromised yourself seriously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be recovered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have tried and failed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will not sell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stolen, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked\\r\\nher house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice\\r\\nshe has been waylaid. There has been no result.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No sign of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Absolutely none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed. \"It is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But a very serious one to me,\" returned the King reproachfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the\\r\\nphotograph?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To ruin me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am about to be married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I have heard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the\\r\\nKing of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her\\r\\nfamily. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a\\r\\ndoubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Irene Adler?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I\\r\\nknow that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul\\r\\nof steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and\\r\\nthe mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry\\r\\nanother woman, there are no lengths to which she would not\\r\\ngo--none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\r\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, then we have three days yet,\" said Holmes with a yawn. \"That\\r\\nis very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to\\r\\nlook into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in\\r\\nLondon for the present?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the\\r\\nCount Von Kramm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, as to money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have carte blanche.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Absolutely?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom\\r\\nto have that photograph.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And for present expenses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak\\r\\nand laid it on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in\\r\\nnotes,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and\\r\\nhanded it to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Mademoiselle\\'s address?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\\'s Wood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took a note of it. \"One other question,\" said he. \"Was the\\r\\nphotograph a cabinet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon\\r\\nhave some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\" he added,\\r\\nas the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \"If\\r\\nyou will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three\\r\\no\\'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three o\\'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had\\r\\nnot yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the\\r\\nhouse shortly after eight o\\'clock in the morning. I sat down\\r\\nbeside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,\\r\\nhowever long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his\\r\\ninquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and\\r\\nstrange features which were associated with the two crimes which\\r\\nI have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the\\r\\nexalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.\\r\\nIndeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my\\r\\nfriend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of\\r\\na situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a\\r\\npleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\r\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most\\r\\ninextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable\\r\\nsuccess that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to\\r\\nenter into my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a\\r\\ndrunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an\\r\\ninflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.\\r\\nAccustomed as I was to my friend\\'s amazing powers in the use of\\r\\ndisguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it\\r\\nwas indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he\\r\\nemerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.\\r\\nPutting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in\\r\\nfront of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, really!\" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again\\r\\nuntil he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I\\r\\nemployed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the\\r\\nhabits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,\\r\\nhowever. I left the house a little after eight o\\'clock this\\r\\nmorning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a\\r\\nwonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of\\r\\nthem, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found\\r\\nBriony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but\\r\\nbuilt out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock\\r\\nto the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well\\r\\nfurnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those\\r\\npreposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.\\r\\nBehind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\r\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round\\r\\nit and examined it closely from every point of view, but without\\r\\nnoting anything else of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that\\r\\nthere was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the\\r\\ngarden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,\\r\\nand received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two\\r\\nfills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire\\r\\nabout Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in\\r\\nthe neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but\\r\\nwhose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what of Irene Adler?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, she has turned all the men\\'s heads down in that part. She is\\r\\nthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\\r\\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,\\r\\ndrives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for\\r\\ndinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.\\r\\nHas only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,\\r\\nhandsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and\\r\\noften twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See\\r\\nthe advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him\\r\\nhome a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.\\r\\nWhen I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up\\r\\nand down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan\\r\\nof campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the\\r\\nmatter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the\\r\\nrelation between them, and what the object of his repeated\\r\\nvisits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the\\r\\nformer, she had probably transferred the photograph to his\\r\\nkeeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this\\r\\nquestion depended whether I should continue my work at Briony\\r\\nLodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\\'s chambers in the\\r\\nTemple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my\\r\\ninquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to\\r\\nlet you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the\\r\\nsituation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am following you closely,\" I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab\\r\\ndrove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a\\r\\nremarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently\\r\\nthe man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a\\r\\ngreat hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the\\r\\nmaid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly\\r\\nat home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch\\r\\nglimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and\\r\\ndown, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see\\r\\nnothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than\\r\\nbefore. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from\\r\\nhis pocket and looked at it earnestly, \\'Drive like the devil,\\' he\\r\\nshouted, \\'first to Gross & Hankey\\'s in Regent Street, and then to\\r\\nthe Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if\\r\\nyou do it in twenty minutes!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do\\r\\nwell to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,\\r\\nthe coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under\\r\\nhis ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of\\r\\nthe buckles. It hadn\\'t pulled up before she shot out of the hall\\r\\ndoor and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,\\r\\nbut she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'The Church of St. Monica, John,\\' she cried, \\'and half a\\r\\nsovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing\\r\\nwhether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her\\r\\nlandau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked\\r\\ntwice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could\\r\\nobject. \\'The Church of St. Monica,\\' said I, \\'and half a sovereign\\r\\nif you reach it in twenty minutes.\\' It was twenty-five minutes to\\r\\ntwelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My cabby drove fast. I don\\'t think I ever drove faster, but the\\r\\nothers were there before us. The cab and the landau with their\\r\\nsteaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid\\r\\nthe man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there\\r\\nsave the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who\\r\\nseemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three\\r\\nstanding in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side\\r\\naisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.\\r\\nSuddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\r\\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Thank God,\\' he cried. \\'You\\'ll do. Come! Come!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What then?\\' I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\\'t be legal.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was\\r\\nI found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,\\r\\nand vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally\\r\\nassisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to\\r\\nGodfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and\\r\\nthere was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady\\r\\non the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was\\r\\nthe most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my\\r\\nlife, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just\\r\\nnow. It seems that there had been some informality about their\\r\\nlicense, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them\\r\\nwithout a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance\\r\\nsaved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in\\r\\nsearch of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean\\r\\nto wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\" said I; \"and what\\r\\nthen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if\\r\\nthe pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate\\r\\nvery prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church\\r\\ndoor, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and\\r\\nshe to her own house. \\'I shall drive out in the park at five as\\r\\nusual,\\' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove\\r\\naway in different directions, and I went off to make my own\\r\\narrangements.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which are?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\" he answered, ringing the\\r\\nbell. \"I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to\\r\\nbe busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want\\r\\nyour co-operation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be delighted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mind breaking the law?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor running a chance of arrest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in a good cause.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, the cause is excellent!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I am your man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was sure that I might rely on you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what is it you wish?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to\\r\\nyou. Now,\" he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that\\r\\nour landlady had provided, \"I must discuss it while I eat, for I\\r\\nhave not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must\\r\\nbe on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns\\r\\nfrom her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to\\r\\noccur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must\\r\\nnot interfere, come what may. You understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am to be neutral?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\r\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being\\r\\nconveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the\\r\\nsitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close\\r\\nto that open window.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what\\r\\nI give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of\\r\\nfire. You quite follow me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is nothing very formidable,\" he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\r\\nroll from his pocket. \"It is an ordinary plumber\\'s smoke-rocket,\\r\\nfitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.\\r\\nYour task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,\\r\\nit will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then\\r\\nwalk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten\\r\\nminutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,\\r\\nand at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry\\r\\nof fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you may entirely rely on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I\\r\\nprepare for the new role I have to play.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in\\r\\nthe character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist\\r\\nclergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white\\r\\ntie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and\\r\\nbenevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have\\r\\nequalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His\\r\\nexpression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every\\r\\nfresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as\\r\\nscience lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in\\r\\ncrime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\\r\\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in\\r\\nSerpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just\\r\\nbeing lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,\\r\\nwaiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such\\r\\nas I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\\' succinct description,\\r\\nbut the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\\r\\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was\\r\\nremarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men\\r\\nsmoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his\\r\\nwheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and\\r\\nseveral well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with\\r\\ncigars in their mouths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see,\" remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of\\r\\nthe house, \"this marriage rather simplifies matters. The\\r\\nphotograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are\\r\\nthat she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey\\r\\nNorton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his\\r\\nprincess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the\\r\\nphotograph?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where, indeed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is\\r\\ncabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\\'s\\r\\ndress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid\\r\\nand searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We\\r\\nmay take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But\\r\\nI am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,\\r\\nand they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it\\r\\nover to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but\\r\\nshe could not tell what indirect or political influence might be\\r\\nbrought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she\\r\\nhad resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she\\r\\ncan lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it has twice been burgled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pshaw! They did not know how to look.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how will you look?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not look.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will get her to show me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she will refuse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is\\r\\nher carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round\\r\\nthe curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which\\r\\nrattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of\\r\\nthe loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in\\r\\nthe hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another\\r\\nloafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce\\r\\nquarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who\\r\\ntook sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,\\r\\nwho was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and\\r\\nin an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was\\r\\nthe centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\r\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\\r\\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached\\r\\nher he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood\\r\\nrunning freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to\\r\\ntheir heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while\\r\\na number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle\\r\\nwithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to\\r\\nattend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,\\r\\nhad hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her\\r\\nsuperb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking\\r\\nback into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is dead,\" cried several voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, there\\'s life in him!\" shouted another. \"But he\\'ll be\\r\\ngone before you can get him to hospital.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s a brave fellow,\" said a woman. \"They would have had the\\r\\nlady\\'s purse and watch if it hadn\\'t been for him. They were a\\r\\ngang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\\'s breathing now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He can\\'t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable\\r\\nsofa. This way, please!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out\\r\\nin the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings\\r\\nfrom my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the\\r\\nblinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay\\r\\nupon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with\\r\\ncompunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I\\r\\nknow that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life\\r\\nthan when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was\\r\\nconspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited\\r\\nupon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery\\r\\nto Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted\\r\\nto me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under\\r\\nmy ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are\\r\\nbut preventing her from injuring another.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man\\r\\nwho is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the\\r\\nwindow. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the\\r\\nsignal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \"Fire!\" The\\r\\nword was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of\\r\\nspectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and\\r\\nservant-maids--joined in a general shriek of \"Fire!\" Thick clouds\\r\\nof smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I\\r\\ncaught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice\\r\\nof Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.\\r\\nSlipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\\r\\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my\\r\\nfriend\\'s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.\\r\\nHe walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we\\r\\nhad turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the\\r\\nEdgeware Road.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did it very nicely, Doctor,\" he remarked. \"Nothing could\\r\\nhave been better. It is all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have the photograph?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know where it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how did you find out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She showed me, as I told you she would.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am still in the dark.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not wish to make a mystery,\" said he, laughing. \"The matter\\r\\nwas perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the\\r\\nstreet was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guessed as much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in\\r\\nthe palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand\\r\\nto my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That also I could fathom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else\\r\\ncould she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room\\r\\nwhich I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was\\r\\ndetermined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for\\r\\nair, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your\\r\\nchance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did that help you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on\\r\\nfire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she\\r\\nvalues most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have\\r\\nmore than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the\\r\\nDarlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in\\r\\nthe Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;\\r\\nan unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to\\r\\nme that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious\\r\\nto her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.\\r\\nThe alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were\\r\\nenough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\\r\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the\\r\\nright bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a\\r\\nglimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it\\r\\nwas a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed\\r\\nfrom the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making\\r\\nmy excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to\\r\\nattempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had\\r\\ncome in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to\\r\\nwait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\\r\\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be\\r\\nshown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is\\r\\nprobable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the\\r\\nphotograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain\\r\\nit with his own hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when will you call?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall\\r\\nhave a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage\\r\\nmay mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to\\r\\nthe King without delay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\\r\\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the\\r\\ngreeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had\\r\\nhurried by.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard that voice before,\" said Holmes, staring down the\\r\\ndimly lit street. \"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have\\r\\nbeen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our\\r\\ntoast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed\\r\\ninto the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have really got it!\" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by\\r\\neither shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you have hopes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have hopes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must have a cab.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my brougham is waiting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then that will simplify matters.\" We descended and started off\\r\\nonce more for Briony Lodge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Irene Adler is married,\" remarked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Married! When?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But to whom?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To an English lawyer named Norton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she could not love him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am in hopes that she does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why in hopes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future\\r\\nannoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your\\r\\nMajesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason\\r\\nwhy she should interfere with your Majesty\\'s plan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own\\r\\nstation! What a queen she would have made!\" He relapsed into a\\r\\nmoody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in\\r\\nSerpentine Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood\\r\\nupon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped\\r\\nfrom the brougham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Mr. Holmes,\" answered my companion, looking at her with a\\r\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She\\r\\nleft this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing\\r\\nCross for the Continent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\r\\nsurprise. \"Do you mean that she has left England?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never to return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the papers?\" asked the King hoarsely. \"All is lost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall see.\" He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\\r\\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and\\r\\nopen drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before\\r\\nher flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small\\r\\nsliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a\\r\\nphotograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler\\r\\nherself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to\\r\\n\"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\" My friend\\r\\ntore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at\\r\\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You\\r\\ntook me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\\r\\nsuspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\\r\\nbegan to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\\r\\nbeen told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly\\r\\nbe you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,\\r\\nyou made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\r\\nsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind\\r\\nold clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress\\r\\nmyself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage\\r\\nof the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to\\r\\nwatch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call\\r\\nthem, and came down just as you departed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\\r\\nreally an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and\\r\\nstarted for the Temple to see my husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\\r\\nso formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when\\r\\nyou call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\\r\\npeace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may\\r\\ndo what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\\r\\nwronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\\r\\nweapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\\r\\ntake in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\\r\\npossess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                      \"Very truly yours,\\r\\n                                   \"IRENE NORTON, n\\xe9e ADLER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a woman--oh, what a woman!\" cried the King of Bohemia, when\\r\\nwe had all three read this epistle. \"Did I not tell you how quick\\r\\nand resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?\\r\\nIs it not a pity that she was not on my level?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a\\r\\nvery different level to your Majesty,\" said Holmes coldly. \"I am\\r\\nsorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\\'s business\\r\\nto a more successful conclusion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary, my dear sir,\" cried the King; \"nothing could be\\r\\nmore successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The\\r\\nphotograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can\\r\\nreward you. This ring--\" He slipped an emerald snake ring from\\r\\nhis finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more\\r\\nhighly,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have but to name it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This photograph!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Irene\\'s photograph!\" he cried. \"Certainly, if you wish it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the\\r\\nmatter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.\" He\\r\\nbowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the\\r\\nKing had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his\\r\\nchambers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom\\r\\nof Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were\\r\\nbeaten by a woman\\'s wit. He used to make merry over the\\r\\ncleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And\\r\\nwhen he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her\\r\\nphotograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\r\\n\\r\\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the\\r\\nautumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a\\r\\nvery stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.\\r\\nWith an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when\\r\\nHolmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door\\r\\nbehind me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear\\r\\nWatson,\" he said cordially.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was afraid that you were engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I am. Very much so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I can wait in the next room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and\\r\\nhelper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no\\r\\ndoubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\\r\\ngreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\\r\\nfat-encircled eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Try the settee,\" said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and\\r\\nputting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in\\r\\njudicial moods. \"I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love\\r\\nof all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum\\r\\nroutine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by\\r\\nthe enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you\\r\\nwill excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own\\r\\nlittle adventures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\" I\\r\\nobserved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we\\r\\nwent into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary\\r\\nSutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary\\r\\ncombinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more\\r\\ndaring than any effort of the imagination.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my\\r\\nview, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you\\r\\nuntil your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to\\r\\nbe right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call\\r\\nupon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to\\r\\nbe one of the most singular which I have listened to for some\\r\\ntime. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique\\r\\nthings are very often connected not with the larger but with the\\r\\nsmaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for\\r\\ndoubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I\\r\\nhave heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present\\r\\ncase is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is\\r\\ncertainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\\r\\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to\\r\\nrecommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend\\r\\nDr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the\\r\\npeculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every\\r\\npossible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some\\r\\nslight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide\\r\\nmyself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my\\r\\nmemory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the\\r\\nfacts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\\r\\nlittle pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the\\r\\ninside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the\\r\\nadvertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper\\r\\nflattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and\\r\\nendeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the\\r\\nindications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor\\r\\nbore every mark of being an average commonplace British\\r\\ntradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey\\r\\nshepherd\\'s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,\\r\\nunbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy\\r\\nAlbert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as\\r\\nan ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a\\r\\nwrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,\\r\\nlook as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save\\r\\nhis blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\\r\\ndiscontent upon his features.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes\\' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook\\r\\nhis head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.\\r\\n\"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual\\r\\nlabour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has\\r\\nbeen in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of\\r\\nwriting lately, I can deduce nothing else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger\\r\\nupon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes?\" he asked. \"How did you know, for example, that I did\\r\\nmanual labour. It\\'s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\\'s\\r\\ncarpenter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger\\r\\nthan your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more\\r\\ndeveloped.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\r\\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you\\r\\nuse an arc-and-compass breastpin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for\\r\\nfive inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the\\r\\nelbow where you rest it upon the desk?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but China?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right\\r\\nwrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small\\r\\nstudy of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature\\r\\nof the subject. That trick of staining the fishes\\' scales of a\\r\\ndelicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I\\r\\nsee a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter\\r\\nbecomes even more simple.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \"Well, I never!\" said he. \"I\\r\\nthought at first that you had done something clever, but I see\\r\\nthat there was nothing in it, after all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I begin to think, Watson,\" said Holmes, \"that I make a mistake\\r\\nin explaining. \\'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\\' you know, and my\\r\\npoor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I\\r\\nam so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I have got it now,\" he answered with his thick red finger\\r\\nplanted halfway down the column. \"Here it is. This is what began\\r\\nit all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late\\r\\nEzekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now\\r\\nanother vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a\\r\\nsalary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All\\r\\nred-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age\\r\\nof twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at\\r\\neleven o\\'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7\\r\\nPope\\'s Court, Fleet Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What on earth does this mean?\" I ejaculated after I had twice\\r\\nread over the extraordinary announcement.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when\\r\\nin high spirits. \"It is a little off the beaten track, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\nsaid he. \"And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us\\r\\nall about yourself, your household, and the effect which this\\r\\nadvertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,\\r\\nDoctor, of the paper and the date.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months\\r\\nago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes,\" said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \"I have a small\\r\\npawnbroker\\'s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It\\'s not a\\r\\nvery large affair, and of late years it has not done more than\\r\\njust give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,\\r\\nbut now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but\\r\\nthat he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the name of this obliging youth?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\\'s not such a youth,\\r\\neither. It\\'s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter\\r\\nassistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better\\r\\nhimself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after\\r\\nall, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ\\xe9 who\\r\\ncomes under the full market price. It is not a common experience\\r\\namong employers in this age. I don\\'t know that your assistant is\\r\\nnot as remarkable as your advertisement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, he has his faults, too,\" said Mr. Wilson. \"Never was such a\\r\\nfellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought\\r\\nto be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar\\r\\nlike a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his\\r\\nmain fault, but on the whole he\\'s a good worker. There\\'s no vice\\r\\nin him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is still with you, I presume?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple\\r\\ncooking and keeps the place clean--that\\'s all I have in the\\r\\nhouse, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very\\r\\nquietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads\\r\\nand pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.\\r\\nSpaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight\\r\\nweeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why that?\\' I asks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why,\\' says he, \\'here\\'s another vacancy on the League of the\\r\\nRed-headed Men. It\\'s worth quite a little fortune to any man who\\r\\ngets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than\\r\\nthere are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\\' end what\\r\\nto do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here\\'s\\r\\na nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why, what is it, then?\\' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a\\r\\nvery stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of\\r\\nmy having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting\\r\\nmy foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn\\'t know much of what\\r\\nwas going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\\' he\\r\\nasked with his eyes open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Never.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one\\r\\nof the vacancies.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And what are they worth?\\' I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight,\\r\\nand it need not interfere very much with one\\'s other\\r\\noccupations.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,\\r\\nfor the business has not been over-good for some years, and an\\r\\nextra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tell me all about it,\\' said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well,\\' said he, showing me the advertisement, \\'you can see for\\r\\nyourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address\\r\\nwhere you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,\\r\\nthe League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah\\r\\nHopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself\\r\\nred-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;\\r\\nso when he died it was found that he had left his enormous\\r\\nfortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the\\r\\ninterest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of\\r\\nthat colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to\\r\\ndo.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'But,\\' said I, \\'there would be millions of red-headed men who\\r\\nwould apply.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Not so many as you might think,\\' he answered. \\'You see it is\\r\\nreally confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had\\r\\nstarted from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the\\r\\nold town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your\\r\\napplying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but\\r\\nreal bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.\\r\\nWilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be\\r\\nworth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a\\r\\nfew hundred pounds.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,\\r\\nthat my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed\\r\\nto me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I\\r\\nstood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent\\r\\nSpaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might\\r\\nprove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for\\r\\nthe day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to\\r\\nhave a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for\\r\\nthe address that was given us in the advertisement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\\r\\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in\\r\\nhis hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.\\r\\nFleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\\'s Court\\r\\nlooked like a coster\\'s orange barrow. I should not have thought\\r\\nthere were so many in the whole country as were brought together\\r\\nby that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they\\r\\nwere--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;\\r\\nbut, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real\\r\\nvivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I\\r\\nwould have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear\\r\\nof it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and\\r\\npulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up\\r\\nto the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream\\r\\nupon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back\\r\\ndejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found\\r\\nourselves in the office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your experience has been a most entertaining one,\" remarked\\r\\nHolmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge\\r\\npinch of snuff. \"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs\\r\\nand a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that\\r\\nwas even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate\\r\\nas he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in\\r\\nthem which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem\\r\\nto be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn\\r\\ncame the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of\\r\\nthe others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he\\r\\nmight have a private word with us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\\' said my assistant, \\'and he is\\r\\nwilling to fill a vacancy in the League.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And he is admirably suited for it,\\' the other answered. \\'He has\\r\\nevery requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so\\r\\nfine.\\' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and\\r\\ngazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he\\r\\nplunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my\\r\\nsuccess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'It would be injustice to hesitate,\\' said he. \\'You will,\\r\\nhowever, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\\'\\r\\nWith that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I\\r\\nyelled with the pain. \\'There is water in your eyes,\\' said he as\\r\\nhe released me. \\'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we\\r\\nhave to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and\\r\\nonce by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler\\'s wax which\\r\\nwould disgust you with human nature.\\' He stepped over to the\\r\\nwindow and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the\\r\\nvacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,\\r\\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions until there\\r\\nwas not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the\\r\\nmanager.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'My name,\\' said he, \\'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of\\r\\nthe pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are\\r\\nyou a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I answered that I had not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His face fell immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Dear me!\\' he said gravely, \\'that is very serious indeed! I am\\r\\nsorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the\\r\\npropagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their\\r\\nmaintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a\\r\\nbachelor.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was\\r\\nnot to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for\\r\\na few minutes he said that it would be all right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'In the case of another,\\' said he, \\'the objection might be\\r\\nfatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a\\r\\nhead of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your\\r\\nnew duties?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\\'\\r\\nsaid I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\\' said Vincent Spaulding.\\r\\n\\'I should be able to look after that for you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What would be the hours?\\' I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ten to two.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now a pawnbroker\\'s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just\\r\\nbefore pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in\\r\\nthe mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man,\\r\\nand that he would see to anything that turned up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'That would suit me very well,\\' said I. \\'And the pay?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Is 4 pounds a week.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And the work?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Is purely nominal.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What do you call purely nominal?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the\\r\\nbuilding, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole\\r\\nposition forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You\\r\\ndon\\'t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office\\r\\nduring that time.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'It\\'s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\\'\\r\\nsaid I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No excuse will avail,\\' said Mr. Duncan Ross; \\'neither sickness\\r\\nnor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose\\r\\nyour billet.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And the work?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Is to copy out the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica.\" There is the first\\r\\nvolume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\r\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be\\r\\nready to-morrow?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Certainly,\\' I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you\\r\\nonce more on the important position which you have been fortunate\\r\\nenough to gain.\\' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with\\r\\nmy assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased\\r\\nat my own good fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in\\r\\nlow spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the\\r\\nwhole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its\\r\\nobject might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past\\r\\nbelief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay\\r\\nsuch a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the\\r\\n\\'Encyclopaedia Britannica.\\' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to\\r\\ncheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the\\r\\nwhole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look\\r\\nat it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a\\r\\nquill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for\\r\\nPope\\'s Court.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as\\r\\npossible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross\\r\\nwas there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off\\r\\nupon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from\\r\\ntime to time to see that all was right with me. At two o\\'clock he\\r\\nbade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had\\r\\nwritten, and locked the door of the office after me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the\\r\\nmanager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my\\r\\nweek\\'s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week\\r\\nafter. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I\\r\\nleft at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only\\r\\nonce of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at\\r\\nall. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an\\r\\ninstant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet\\r\\nwas such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk\\r\\nthe loss of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about\\r\\nAbbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and\\r\\nhoped with diligence that I might get on to the B\\'s before very\\r\\nlong. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly\\r\\nfilled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole\\r\\nbusiness came to an end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To an end?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as\\r\\nusual at ten o\\'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a\\r\\nlittle square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the\\r\\npanel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet\\r\\nof note-paper. It read in this fashion:\\r\\n\\r\\n                  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\r\\n\\r\\n                           IS\\r\\n\\r\\n                        DISSOLVED.\\r\\n\\r\\n                     October 9, 1890.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the\\r\\nrueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so\\r\\ncompletely overtopped every other consideration that we both\\r\\nburst out into a roar of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see that there is anything very funny,\" cried our\\r\\nclient, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \"If you can\\r\\ndo nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from\\r\\nwhich he had half risen. \"I really wouldn\\'t miss your case for\\r\\nthe world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you\\r\\nwill excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.\\r\\nPray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the\\r\\ndoor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called\\r\\nat the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything\\r\\nabout it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant\\r\\nliving on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me\\r\\nwhat had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had\\r\\nnever heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan\\r\\nRoss was. He answered that the name was new to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well,\\' said I, \\'the gentleman at No. 4.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What, the red-headed man?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh,\\' said he, \\'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor\\r\\nand was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new\\r\\npremises were ready. He moved out yesterday.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Where could I find him?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17\\r\\nKing Edward Street, near St. Paul\\'s.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was\\r\\na manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever\\r\\nheard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did you do then?\" asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\\r\\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say\\r\\nthat if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite\\r\\ngood enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place\\r\\nwithout a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough\\r\\nto give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right\\r\\naway to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you did very wisely,\" said Holmes. \"Your case is an\\r\\nexceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.\\r\\nFrom what you have told me I think that it is possible that\\r\\ngraver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Grave enough!\" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \"Why, I have lost four\\r\\npound a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As far as you are personally concerned,\" remarked Holmes, \"I do\\r\\nnot see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary\\r\\nleague. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some\\r\\n30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have\\r\\ngained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have\\r\\nlost nothing by them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,\\r\\nand what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a\\r\\nprank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it\\r\\ncost them two and thirty pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,\\r\\none or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who\\r\\nfirst called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he\\r\\nbeen with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did he come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In answer to an advertisement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was he the only applicant?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I had a dozen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you pick him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because he was handy and would come cheap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At half-wages, in fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\\r\\nthough he\\'s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon\\r\\nhis forehead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \"I thought\\r\\nas much,\" said he. \"Have you ever observed that his ears are\\r\\npierced for earrings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he\\r\\nwas a lad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum!\" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \"He is still\\r\\nwith you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And has your business been attended to in your absence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing to complain of, sir. There\\'s never very much to do of a\\r\\nmorning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an\\r\\nopinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is\\r\\nSaturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Watson,\" said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \"what\\r\\ndo you make of it all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I make nothing of it,\" I answered frankly. \"It is a most\\r\\nmysterious business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As a rule,\" said Holmes, \"the more bizarre a thing is the less\\r\\nmysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless\\r\\ncrimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is\\r\\nthe most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this\\r\\nmatter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you going to do, then?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To smoke,\" he answered. \"It is quite a three pipe problem, and I\\r\\nbeg that you won\\'t speak to me for fifty minutes.\" He curled\\r\\nhimself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his\\r\\nhawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his\\r\\nblack clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.\\r\\nI had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and\\r\\nindeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his\\r\\nchair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put\\r\\nhis pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sarasate plays at the St. James\\'s Hall this afternoon,\" he\\r\\nremarked. \"What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare\\r\\nyou for a few hours?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very\\r\\nabsorbing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City\\r\\nfirst, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that\\r\\nthere is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is\\r\\nrather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is\\r\\nintrospective, and I want to introspect. Come along!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short\\r\\nwalk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular\\r\\nstory which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,\\r\\nlittle, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy\\r\\ntwo-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in\\r\\nenclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded\\r\\nlaurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and\\r\\nuncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with\\r\\n\"JABEZ WILSON\" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced\\r\\nthe place where our red-headed client carried on his business.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side\\r\\nand looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between\\r\\npuckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down\\r\\nagain to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally\\r\\nhe returned to the pawnbroker\\'s, and, having thumped vigorously\\r\\nupon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up\\r\\nto the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a\\r\\nbright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step\\r\\nin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes, \"I only wished to ask you how you would\\r\\ngo from here to the Strand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Third right, fourth left,\" answered the assistant promptly,\\r\\nclosing the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Smart fellow, that,\" observed Holmes as we walked away. \"He is,\\r\\nin my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring\\r\\nI am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known\\r\\nsomething of him before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Evidently,\" said I, \"Mr. Wilson\\'s assistant counts for a good\\r\\ndeal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you\\r\\ninquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The knees of his trousers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did you see?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What I expected to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you beat the pavement?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We\\r\\nare spies in an enemy\\'s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg\\r\\nSquare. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the\\r\\ncorner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a\\r\\ncontrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was\\r\\none of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City\\r\\nto the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense\\r\\nstream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,\\r\\nwhile the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of\\r\\npedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line\\r\\nof fine shops and stately business premises that they really\\r\\nabutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square\\r\\nwhich we had just quitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me see,\" said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing\\r\\nalong the line, \"I should like just to remember the order of the\\r\\nhouses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of\\r\\nLondon. There is Mortimer\\'s, the tobacconist, the little\\r\\nnewspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,\\r\\nthe Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\\'s carriage-building\\r\\ndepot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,\\r\\nDoctor, we\\'ve done our work, so it\\'s time we had some play. A\\r\\nsandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where\\r\\nall is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\\r\\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a\\r\\nvery capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All\\r\\nthe afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect\\r\\nhappiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the\\r\\nmusic, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes\\r\\nwere as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the\\r\\nrelentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was\\r\\npossible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature\\r\\nalternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and\\r\\nastuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction\\r\\nagainst the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally\\r\\npredominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\\r\\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was\\r\\nnever so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been\\r\\nlounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his\\r\\nblack-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase\\r\\nwould suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning\\r\\npower would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were\\r\\nunacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a\\r\\nman whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him\\r\\nthat afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James\\'s Hall I\\r\\nfelt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set\\r\\nhimself to hunt down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\" he remarked as we\\r\\nemerged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it would be as well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\\r\\nbusiness at Coburg Square is serious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why serious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\\r\\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being\\r\\nSaturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help\\r\\nto-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At what time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten will be early enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger,\\r\\nso kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\" He waved his\\r\\nhand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the\\r\\ncrowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was\\r\\nalways oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings\\r\\nwith Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had\\r\\nseen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that\\r\\nhe saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to\\r\\nhappen, while to me the whole business was still confused and\\r\\ngrotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought\\r\\nover it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed\\r\\ncopier of the \"Encyclopaedia\" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg\\r\\nSquare, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.\\r\\nWhat was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\\r\\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from\\r\\nHolmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\\'s assistant was a\\r\\nformidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to\\r\\npuzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside\\r\\nuntil night should bring an explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my\\r\\nway across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker\\r\\nStreet. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered\\r\\nthe passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering\\r\\nhis room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,\\r\\none of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police\\r\\nagent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a\\r\\nvery shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! Our party is complete,\" said Holmes, buttoning up his\\r\\npea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.\\r\\n\"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me\\r\\nintroduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in\\r\\nto-night\\'s adventure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\" said Jones in\\r\\nhis consequential way. \"Our friend here is a wonderful man for\\r\\nstarting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do\\r\\nthe running down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\"\\r\\nobserved Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\" said\\r\\nthe police agent loftily. \"He has his own little methods, which\\r\\nare, if he won\\'t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical\\r\\nand fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It\\r\\nis not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of\\r\\nthe Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly\\r\\ncorrect than the official force.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\" said the\\r\\nstranger with deference. \"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.\\r\\nIt is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I\\r\\nhave not had my rubber.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you will find,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"that you will\\r\\nplay for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and\\r\\nthat the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,\\r\\nthe stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will\\r\\nbe the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\\'s a\\r\\nyoung man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his\\r\\nprofession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on\\r\\nany criminal in London. He\\'s a remarkable man, is young John\\r\\nClay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been\\r\\nto Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and\\r\\nthough we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to\\r\\nfind the man himself. He\\'ll crack a crib in Scotland one week,\\r\\nand be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\r\\nI\\'ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him\\r\\nyet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.\\r\\nI\\'ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I\\r\\nagree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is\\r\\npast ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two\\r\\nwill take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the\\r\\nsecond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive\\r\\nand lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in\\r\\nthe afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit\\r\\nstreets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are close there now,\" my friend remarked. \"This fellow\\r\\nMerryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the\\r\\nmatter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is\\r\\nnot a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.\\r\\nHe has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as\\r\\ntenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we\\r\\nare, and they are waiting for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had\\r\\nfound ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,\\r\\nfollowing the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a\\r\\nnarrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.\\r\\nWithin there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive\\r\\niron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding\\r\\nstone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.\\r\\nMerryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us\\r\\ndown a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a\\r\\nthird door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all\\r\\nround with crates and massive boxes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not very vulnerable from above,\" Holmes remarked as he\\r\\nheld up the lantern and gazed about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor from below,\" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon\\r\\nthe flags which lined the floor. \"Why, dear me, it sounds quite\\r\\nhollow!\" he remarked, looking up in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\" said Holmes\\r\\nseverely. \"You have already imperilled the whole success of our\\r\\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit\\r\\ndown upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a\\r\\nvery injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his\\r\\nknees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,\\r\\nbegan to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few\\r\\nseconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again\\r\\nand put his glass in his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have at least an hour before us,\" he remarked, \"for they can\\r\\nhardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.\\r\\nThen they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their\\r\\nwork the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at\\r\\npresent, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of\\r\\nthe City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.\\r\\nMerryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to\\r\\nyou that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of\\r\\nLondon should take a considerable interest in this cellar at\\r\\npresent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is our French gold,\" whispered the director. \"We have had\\r\\nseveral warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your French gold?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources\\r\\nand borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of\\r\\nFrance. It has become known that we have never had occasion to\\r\\nunpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The\\r\\ncrate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between\\r\\nlayers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at\\r\\npresent than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the\\r\\ndirectors have had misgivings upon the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which were very well justified,\" observed Holmes. \"And now it is\\r\\ntime that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an\\r\\nhour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.\\r\\nMerryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And sit in the dark?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and\\r\\nI thought that, as we were a partie carr\\xe9e, you might have your\\r\\nrubber after all. But I see that the enemy\\'s preparations have\\r\\ngone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,\\r\\nfirst of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men,\\r\\nand though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us\\r\\nsome harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate,\\r\\nand do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a\\r\\nlight upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no\\r\\ncompunction about shooting them down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case\\r\\nbehind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front\\r\\nof his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute\\r\\ndarkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot\\r\\nmetal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready\\r\\nto flash out at a moment\\'s notice. To me, with my nerves worked\\r\\nup to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and\\r\\nsubduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the\\r\\nvault.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have but one retreat,\" whispered Holmes. \"That is back\\r\\nthrough the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have\\r\\ndone what I asked you, Jones?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent\\r\\nand wait.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but\\r\\nan hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must\\r\\nhave almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs\\r\\nwere weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my\\r\\nnerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my\\r\\nhearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle\\r\\nbreathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,\\r\\nheavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note\\r\\nof the bank director. From my position I could look over the case\\r\\nin the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint\\r\\nof a light.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then\\r\\nit lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,\\r\\nwithout any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand\\r\\nappeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the\\r\\ncentre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the\\r\\nhand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then\\r\\nit was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark\\r\\nagain save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between\\r\\nthe stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,\\r\\ntearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon\\r\\nits side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed\\r\\nthe light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,\\r\\nboyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand\\r\\non either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and\\r\\nwaist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another\\r\\ninstant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after\\r\\nhim a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face\\r\\nand a shock of very red hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s all clear,\" he whispered. \"Have you the chisel and the\\r\\nbags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\\'ll swing for it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the\\r\\ncollar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of\\r\\nrending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed\\r\\nupon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes\\' hunting crop came\\r\\ndown on the man\\'s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone\\r\\nfloor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s no use, John Clay,\" said Holmes blandly. \"You have no\\r\\nchance at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I see,\" the other answered with the utmost coolness. \"I fancy\\r\\nthat my pal is all right, though I see you have got his\\r\\ncoat-tails.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are three men waiting for him at the door,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I\\r\\nmust compliment you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I you,\" Holmes answered. \"Your red-headed idea was very new\\r\\nand effective.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll see your pal again presently,\" said Jones. \"He\\'s quicker\\r\\nat climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the\\r\\nderbies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\"\\r\\nremarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.\\r\\n\"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have\\r\\nthe goodness, also, when you address me always to say \\'sir\\' and\\r\\n\\'please.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \"Well, would\\r\\nyou please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry\\r\\nyour Highness to the police-station?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is better,\" said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow\\r\\nto the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the\\r\\ndetective.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Mr. Holmes,\" said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them\\r\\nfrom the cellar, \"I do not know how the bank can thank you or\\r\\nrepay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated\\r\\nin the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts\\r\\nat bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.\\r\\nJohn Clay,\" said Holmes. \"I have been at some small expense over\\r\\nthis matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond\\r\\nthat I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in\\r\\nmany ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of\\r\\nthe Red-headed League.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, Watson,\" he explained in the early hours of the morning\\r\\nas we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \"it\\r\\nwas perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible\\r\\nobject of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of\\r\\nthe League, and the copying of the \\'Encyclopaedia,\\' must be to get\\r\\nthis not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of\\r\\nhours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,\\r\\nreally, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was\\r\\nno doubt suggested to Clay\\'s ingenious mind by the colour of his\\r\\naccomplice\\'s hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw\\r\\nhim, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?\\r\\nThey put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary\\r\\noffice, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and\\r\\ntogether they manage to secure his absence every morning in the\\r\\nweek. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for\\r\\nhalf wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive\\r\\nfor securing the situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how could you guess what the motive was?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a\\r\\nmere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The\\r\\nman\\'s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his\\r\\nhouse which could account for such elaborate preparations, and\\r\\nsuch an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something\\r\\nout of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant\\'s\\r\\nfondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the\\r\\ncellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then\\r\\nI made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I\\r\\nhad to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in\\r\\nLondon. He was doing something in the cellar--something which\\r\\ntook many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once\\r\\nmore? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel\\r\\nto some other building.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\\r\\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\\r\\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.\\r\\nIt was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the\\r\\nassistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had\\r\\nnever set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his\\r\\nface. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have\\r\\nremarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of\\r\\nthose hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they\\r\\nwere burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and\\r\\nSuburban Bank abutted on our friend\\'s premises, and felt that I\\r\\nhad solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I\\r\\ncalled upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank\\r\\ndirectors, with the result that you have seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt\\r\\nto-night?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that\\r\\nthey cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\\'s presence--in other\\r\\nwords, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential\\r\\nthat they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the\\r\\nbullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than\\r\\nany other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.\\r\\nFor all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You reasoned it out beautifully,\" I exclaimed in unfeigned\\r\\nadmiration. \"It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings\\r\\ntrue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It saved me from ennui,\" he answered, yawning. \"Alas! I already\\r\\nfeel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort\\r\\nto escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little\\r\\nproblems help me to do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you are a benefactor of the race,\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, perhaps, after all, it is of\\r\\nsome little use,\" he remarked. \"\\'L\\'homme c\\'est rien--l\\'oeuvre\\r\\nc\\'est tout,\\' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side\\r\\nof the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \"life is infinitely\\r\\nstranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We\\r\\nwould not dare to conceive the things which are really mere\\r\\ncommonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window\\r\\nhand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the\\r\\nroofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the\\r\\nstrange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the\\r\\nwonderful chains of events, working through generations, and\\r\\nleading to the most outr\\xe9 results, it would make all fiction with\\r\\nits conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and\\r\\nunprofitable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet I am not convinced of it,\" I answered. \"The cases which\\r\\ncome to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and\\r\\nvulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to\\r\\nits extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,\\r\\nneither fascinating nor artistic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\\r\\nrealistic effect,\" remarked Holmes. \"This is wanting in the\\r\\npolice report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the\\r\\nplatitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an\\r\\nobserver contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend\\r\\nupon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI smiled and shook my head. \"I can quite understand your thinking\\r\\nso,\" I said. \"Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser\\r\\nand helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout\\r\\nthree continents, you are brought in contact with all that is\\r\\nstrange and bizarre. But here\"--I picked up the morning paper\\r\\nfrom the ground--\"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the\\r\\nfirst heading upon which I come. \\'A husband\\'s cruelty to his\\r\\nwife.\\' There is half a column of print, but I know without\\r\\nreading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of\\r\\ncourse, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\\r\\nbruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of\\r\\nwriters could invent nothing more crude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\"\\r\\nsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \"This\\r\\nis the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged\\r\\nin clearing up some small points in connection with it. The\\r\\nhusband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the\\r\\nconduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of\\r\\nwinding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling\\r\\nthem at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely\\r\\nto occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a\\r\\npinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over\\r\\nyou in your example.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in\\r\\nthe centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his\\r\\nhomely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.\\r\\nIt is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my\\r\\nassistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the ring?\" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\r\\nsparkled upon his finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in\\r\\nwhich I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it\\r\\neven to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of\\r\\nmy little problems.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you any on hand just now?\" I asked with interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of\\r\\ninterest. They are important, you understand, without being\\r\\ninteresting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in\\r\\nunimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,\\r\\nand for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the\\r\\ncharm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the\\r\\nsimpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is\\r\\nthe motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter\\r\\nwhich has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\\r\\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,\\r\\nthat I may have something better before very many minutes are\\r\\nover, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted\\r\\nblinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.\\r\\nLooking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite\\r\\nthere stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,\\r\\nand a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was\\r\\ntilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her\\r\\near. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,\\r\\nhesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated\\r\\nbackward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove\\r\\nbuttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\\r\\nthe bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp\\r\\nclang of the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen those symptoms before,\" said Holmes, throwing his\\r\\ncigarette into the fire. \"Oscillation upon the pavement always\\r\\nmeans an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure\\r\\nthat the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet\\r\\neven here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously\\r\\nwronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom\\r\\nis a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love\\r\\nmatter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or\\r\\ngrieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons\\r\\nentered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself\\r\\nloomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed\\r\\nmerchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed\\r\\nher with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,\\r\\nhaving closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked\\r\\nher over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was\\r\\npeculiar to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you not find,\" he said, \"that with your short sight it is a\\r\\nlittle trying to do so much typewriting?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did at first,\" she answered, \"but now I know where the letters\\r\\nare without looking.\" Then, suddenly realising the full purport\\r\\nof his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear\\r\\nand astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \"You\\'ve\\r\\nheard about me, Mr. Holmes,\" she cried, \"else how could you know\\r\\nall that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind,\" said Holmes, laughing; \"it is my business to know\\r\\nthings. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others\\r\\noverlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,\\r\\nwhose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had\\r\\ngiven him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as\\r\\nmuch for me. I\\'m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in\\r\\nmy own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and\\r\\nI would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\" asked\\r\\nSherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to\\r\\nthe ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss\\r\\nMary Sutherland. \"Yes, I did bang out of the house,\" she said,\\r\\n\"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.\\r\\nWindibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to\\r\\nthe police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he\\r\\nwould do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,\\r\\nit made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away\\r\\nto you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father,\" said Holmes, \"your stepfather, surely, since the\\r\\nname is different.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,\\r\\ntoo, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your mother is alive?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\\'t best pleased, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, when she married again so soon after father\\'s death, and\\r\\na man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father\\r\\nwas a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy\\r\\nbusiness behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the\\r\\nforeman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the\\r\\nbusiness, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.\\r\\nThey got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\\'t\\r\\nnear as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this\\r\\nrambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he\\r\\nhad listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your own little income,\" he asked, \"does it come out of the\\r\\nbusiness?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle\\r\\nNed in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per\\r\\ncent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can\\r\\nonly touch the interest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You interest me extremely,\" said Holmes. \"And since you draw so\\r\\nlarge a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the\\r\\nbargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in\\r\\nevery way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely\\r\\nupon an income of about 60 pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you\\r\\nunderstand that as long as I live at home I don\\'t wish to be a\\r\\nburden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while\\r\\nI am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the\\r\\ntime. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it\\r\\nover to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I\\r\\nearn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can\\r\\noften do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have made your position very clear to me,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as\\r\\nfreely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your\\r\\nconnection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\\'s face, and she picked\\r\\nnervously at the fringe of her jacket. \"I met him first at the\\r\\ngasfitters\\' ball,\" she said. \"They used to send father tickets\\r\\nwhen he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and\\r\\nsent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He\\r\\nnever did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I\\r\\nwanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I\\r\\nwas set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to\\r\\nprevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\\r\\nfather\\'s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing\\r\\nfit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much\\r\\nas taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,\\r\\nhe went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,\\r\\nmother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it\\r\\nwas there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose,\" said Holmes, \"that when Mr. Windibank came back from\\r\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying\\r\\nanything to a woman, for she would have her way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see. Then at the gasfitters\\' ball you met, as I understand, a\\r\\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if\\r\\nwe had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to\\r\\nsay, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father\\r\\ncame back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house\\r\\nany more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you know father didn\\'t like anything of the sort. He\\r\\nwouldn\\'t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to\\r\\nsay that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But\\r\\nthen, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to\\r\\nbegin with, and I had not got mine yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer\\r\\nwrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each\\r\\nother until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he\\r\\nused to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so\\r\\nthere was no need for father to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that\\r\\nwe took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in\\r\\nLeadenhall Street--and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What office?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\\'t know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where did he live, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He slept on the premises.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you don\\'t know his address?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where did you address your letters, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called\\r\\nfor. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be\\r\\nchaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,\\r\\nso I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\\'t\\r\\nhave that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come\\r\\nfrom me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the\\r\\nmachine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he\\r\\nwas of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think\\r\\nof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was most suggestive,\" said Holmes. \"It has long been an axiom\\r\\nof mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.\\r\\nCan you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me\\r\\nin the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to\\r\\nbe conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his\\r\\nvoice was gentle. He\\'d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he\\r\\nwas young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,\\r\\nand a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always\\r\\nwell dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just\\r\\nas mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,\\r\\nreturned to France?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we\\r\\nshould marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest\\r\\nand made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever\\r\\nhappened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite\\r\\nright to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.\\r\\nMother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder\\r\\nof him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the\\r\\nweek, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to\\r\\nmind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother\\r\\nsaid she would make it all right with him. I didn\\'t quite like\\r\\nthat, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as\\r\\nhe was only a few years older than me; but I didn\\'t want to do\\r\\nanything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\\r\\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on\\r\\nthe very morning of the wedding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It missed him, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for\\r\\nthe Friday. Was it to be in church?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\\'s, near\\r\\nKing\\'s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.\\r\\nPancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were\\r\\ntwo of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a\\r\\nfour-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the\\r\\nstreet. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler\\r\\ndrove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and\\r\\nwhen the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one\\r\\nthere! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become\\r\\nof him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was\\r\\nlast Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything\\r\\nsince then to throw any light upon what became of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\" said\\r\\nHolmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all\\r\\nthe morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to\\r\\nbe true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to\\r\\nseparate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,\\r\\nand that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed\\r\\nstrange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since\\r\\ngives a meaning to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\\r\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he\\r\\nwould not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw\\r\\nhappened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\\r\\nagain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your father? Did you tell him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had\\r\\nhappened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,\\r\\nwhat interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of\\r\\nthe church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my\\r\\nmoney, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,\\r\\nthere might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about\\r\\nmoney and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what\\r\\ncould have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me\\r\\nhalf-mad to think of it, and I can\\'t sleep a wink at night.\" She\\r\\npulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob\\r\\nheavily into it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall glance into the case for you,\" said Holmes, rising, \"and\\r\\nI have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the\\r\\nweight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind\\r\\ndwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel\\r\\nvanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you don\\'t think I\\'ll see him again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fear not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what has happened to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an\\r\\naccurate description of him and any letters of his which you can\\r\\nspare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I advertised for him in last Saturday\\'s Chronicle,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. And your address?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Angel\\'s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\\r\\nfather\\'s place of business?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers\\r\\nof Fenchurch Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will\\r\\nleave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given\\r\\nyou. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it\\r\\nto affect your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be\\r\\ntrue to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was\\r\\nsomething noble in the simple faith of our visitor which\\r\\ncompelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon\\r\\nthe table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever\\r\\nshe might be summoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips\\r\\nstill pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,\\r\\nand his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down\\r\\nfrom the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a\\r\\ncounsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with\\r\\nthe thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of\\r\\ninfinite languor in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite an interesting study, that maiden,\" he observed. \"I found\\r\\nher more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,\\r\\nis rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you\\r\\nconsult my index, in Andover in \\'77, and there was something of\\r\\nthe sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,\\r\\nthere were one or two details which were new to me. But the\\r\\nmaiden herself was most instructive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite\\r\\ninvisible to me,\" I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to\\r\\nlook, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring\\r\\nyou to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of\\r\\nthumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.\\r\\nNow, what did you gather from that woman\\'s appearance? Describe\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\\r\\nfeather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads\\r\\nsewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her\\r\\ndress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little\\r\\npurple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and\\r\\nwere worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn\\'t\\r\\nobserve. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a\\r\\ngeneral air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,\\r\\neasy-going way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\r\\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\\r\\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and\\r\\nyou have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general\\r\\nimpressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My\\r\\nfirst glance is always at a woman\\'s sleeve. In a man it is\\r\\nperhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you\\r\\nobserve, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most\\r\\nuseful material for showing traces. The double line a little\\r\\nabove the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,\\r\\nwas beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,\\r\\nleaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side\\r\\nof it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the\\r\\nbroadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,\\r\\nobserving the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I\\r\\nventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed\\r\\nto surprise her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It surprised me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and\\r\\ninterested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots\\r\\nwhich she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were\\r\\nreally odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and\\r\\nthe other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower\\r\\nbuttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and\\r\\nfifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly\\r\\ndressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,\\r\\nit is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what else?\" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by\\r\\nmy friend\\'s incisive reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving\\r\\nhome but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right\\r\\nglove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see\\r\\nthat both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had\\r\\nwritten in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been\\r\\nthis morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.\\r\\nAll this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back\\r\\nto business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised\\r\\ndescription of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Missing,\" it said, \"on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman\\r\\nnamed Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;\\r\\nstrongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in\\r\\nthe centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted\\r\\nglasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,\\r\\nin black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert\\r\\nchain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over\\r\\nelastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in\\r\\nLeadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will do,\" said Holmes. \"As to the letters,\" he continued,\\r\\nglancing over them, \"they are very commonplace. Absolutely no\\r\\nclue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There\\r\\nis one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are typewritten,\" I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the\\r\\nneat little \\'Hosmer Angel\\' at the bottom. There is a date, you\\r\\nsee, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is\\r\\nrather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in\\r\\nfact, we may call it conclusive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it\\r\\nbears upon the case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able\\r\\nto deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were\\r\\ninstituted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,\\r\\nwhich should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the\\r\\nother is to the young lady\\'s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking\\r\\nhim whether he could meet us here at six o\\'clock tomorrow\\r\\nevening. It is just as well that we should do business with the\\r\\nmale relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the\\r\\nanswers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem\\r\\nupon the shelf for the interim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\\'s subtle powers\\r\\nof reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that\\r\\nhe must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy\\r\\ndemeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had\\r\\nbeen called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in\\r\\nthe case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler\\r\\nphotograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the\\r\\nSign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with\\r\\nthe Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle\\r\\nindeed which he could not unravel.\\r\\n\\r\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\r\\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would\\r\\nfind that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up\\r\\nto the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary\\r\\nSutherland.\\r\\n\\r\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own\\r\\nattention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at\\r\\nthe bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six\\r\\no\\'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a\\r\\nhansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too\\r\\nlate to assist at the d\\xe9nouement of the little mystery. I found\\r\\nSherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin\\r\\nform curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable\\r\\narray of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell\\r\\nof hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the\\r\\nchemical work which was so dear to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, have you solved it?\" I asked as I entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, the mystery!\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.\\r\\nThere was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said\\r\\nyesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback\\r\\nis that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\\r\\nSutherland?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet\\r\\nopened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the\\r\\npassage and a tap at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the girl\\'s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\" said\\r\\nHolmes. \"He has written to me to say that he would be here at\\r\\nsix. Come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some\\r\\nthirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a\\r\\nbland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and\\r\\npenetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of\\r\\nus, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a\\r\\nslight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\" said Holmes. \"I think that\\r\\nthis typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an\\r\\nappointment with me for six o\\'clock?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not\\r\\nquite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland\\r\\nhas troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far\\r\\nbetter not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite\\r\\nagainst my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,\\r\\nimpulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily\\r\\ncontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I\\r\\ndid not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the\\r\\nofficial police, but it is not pleasant to have a family\\r\\nmisfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless\\r\\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary,\" said Holmes quietly; \"I have every reason to\\r\\nbelieve that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \"I am\\r\\ndelighted to hear it,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a curious thing,\" remarked Holmes, \"that a typewriter has\\r\\nreally quite as much individuality as a man\\'s handwriting. Unless\\r\\nthey are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some\\r\\nletters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one\\r\\nside. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that\\r\\nin every case there is some little slurring over of the \\'e,\\' and\\r\\na slight defect in the tail of the \\'r.\\' There are fourteen other\\r\\ncharacteristics, but those are the more obvious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,\\r\\nand no doubt it is a little worn,\" our visitor answered, glancing\\r\\nkeenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,\\r\\nMr. Windibank,\" Holmes continued. \"I think of writing another\\r\\nlittle monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its\\r\\nrelation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some\\r\\nlittle attention. I have here four letters which purport to come\\r\\nfrom the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not\\r\\nonly are the \\'e\\'s\\' slurred and the \\'r\\'s\\' tailless, but you will\\r\\nobserve, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen\\r\\nother characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \"I\\r\\ncannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\"\\r\\nhe said. \"If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know\\r\\nwhen you have done it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in\\r\\nthe door. \"I let you know, then, that I have caught him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! where?\" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips\\r\\nand glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it won\\'t do--really it won\\'t,\" said Holmes suavely. \"There\\r\\nis no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too\\r\\ntransparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that\\r\\nit was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\\'s\\r\\nright! Sit down and let us talk it over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a\\r\\nglitter of moisture on his brow. \"It--it\\'s not actionable,\" he\\r\\nstammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\\r\\nWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a\\r\\npetty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the\\r\\ncourse of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\\r\\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up\\r\\non the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands\\r\\nin his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,\\r\\nthan to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her\\r\\nmoney,\" said he, \"and he enjoyed the use of the money of the\\r\\ndaughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable\\r\\nsum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have\\r\\nmade a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.\\r\\nThe daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate\\r\\nand warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with\\r\\nher fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would\\r\\nnot be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would\\r\\nmean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her\\r\\nstepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of\\r\\nkeeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of\\r\\npeople of her own age. But soon he found that that would not\\r\\nanswer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and\\r\\nfinally announced her positive intention of going to a certain\\r\\nball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an\\r\\nidea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the\\r\\nconnivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,\\r\\ncovered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with\\r\\na moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice\\r\\ninto an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\\r\\ngirl\\'s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off\\r\\nother lovers by making love himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was only a joke at first,\" groaned our visitor. \"We never\\r\\nthought that she would have been so carried away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very\\r\\ndecidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that\\r\\nher stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never\\r\\nfor an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the\\r\\ngentleman\\'s attentions, and the effect was increased by the\\r\\nloudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began\\r\\nto call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as\\r\\nfar as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There\\r\\nwere meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the\\r\\ngirl\\'s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the\\r\\ndeception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys\\r\\nto France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to\\r\\nbring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it\\r\\nwould leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\\'s mind and\\r\\nprevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to\\r\\ncome. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and\\r\\nhence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening\\r\\non the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss\\r\\nSutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to\\r\\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not\\r\\nlisten to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,\\r\\nand then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished\\r\\naway by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a\\r\\nfour-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of\\r\\nevents, Mr. Windibank!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes\\r\\nhad been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold\\r\\nsneer upon his pale face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"but if you\\r\\nare so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is\\r\\nyou who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing\\r\\nactionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door\\r\\nlocked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal\\r\\nconstraint.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The law cannot, as you say, touch you,\" said Holmes, unlocking\\r\\nand throwing open the door, \"yet there never was a man who\\r\\ndeserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a\\r\\nfriend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\"\\r\\nhe continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon\\r\\nthe man\\'s face, \"it is not part of my duties to my client, but\\r\\nhere\\'s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat\\r\\nmyself to--\" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he\\r\\ncould grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,\\r\\nthe heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.\\r\\nJames Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\" said Holmes, laughing, as he\\r\\nthrew himself down into his chair once more. \"That fellow will\\r\\nrise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and\\r\\nends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not\\r\\nentirely devoid of interest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\" I\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.\\r\\nHosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious\\r\\nconduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really\\r\\nprofited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the\\r\\nstepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,\\r\\nbut that the one always appeared when the other was away, was\\r\\nsuggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,\\r\\nwhich both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My\\r\\nsuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in\\r\\ntypewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\\r\\nhandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even\\r\\nthe smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,\\r\\ntogether with many minor ones, all pointed in the same\\r\\ndirection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how did you verify them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I\\r\\nknew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed\\r\\ndescription. I eliminated everything from it which could be the\\r\\nresult of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I\\r\\nsent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me\\r\\nwhether it answered to the description of any of their\\r\\ntravellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the\\r\\ntypewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business\\r\\naddress asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his\\r\\nreply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but\\r\\ncharacteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\r\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the\\r\\ndescription tallied in every respect with that of their employ\\xe9,\\r\\nJames Windibank. Voil\\xe0 tout!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Miss Sutherland?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old\\r\\nPersian saying, \\'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger\\r\\ncub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\\'\\r\\nThere is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much\\r\\nknowledge of the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the\\r\\nmaid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran\\r\\nin this way:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from\\r\\nthe west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.\\r\\nShall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.\\r\\nLeave Paddington by the 11:15.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you say, dear?\" said my wife, looking across at me.\\r\\n\"Will you go?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really don\\'t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at\\r\\npresent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking\\r\\na little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,\\r\\nand you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\' cases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained\\r\\nthrough one of them,\" I answered. \"But if I am to go, I must pack\\r\\nat once, for I have only half an hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the\\r\\neffect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were\\r\\nfew and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a\\r\\ncab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt\\r\\nfigure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey\\r\\ntravelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is really very good of you to come, Watson,\" said he. \"It\\r\\nmakes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on\\r\\nwhom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless\\r\\nor else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall\\r\\nget the tickets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of\\r\\npapers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged\\r\\nand read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until\\r\\nwe were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a\\r\\ngigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you heard anything of the case?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just\\r\\nbeen looking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\r\\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those\\r\\nsimple cases which are so extremely difficult.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That sounds a little paradoxical.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a\\r\\nclue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more\\r\\ndifficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they\\r\\nhave established a very serious case against the son of the\\r\\nmurdered man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a murder, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for\\r\\ngranted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into\\r\\nit. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have\\r\\nbeen able to understand it, in a very few words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\r\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a\\r\\nMr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned\\r\\nsome years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he\\r\\nheld, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was\\r\\nalso an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the\\r\\ncolonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to\\r\\nsettle down they should do so as near each other as possible.\\r\\nTurner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\\r\\ntenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect\\r\\nequality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,\\r\\na lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same\\r\\nage, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have\\r\\navoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to\\r\\nhave led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of\\r\\nsport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the\\r\\nneighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.\\r\\nTurner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the\\r\\nleast. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\\r\\nfamilies. Now for the facts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\\r\\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the\\r\\nBoscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out\\r\\nof the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been\\r\\nout with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told\\r\\nthe man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of\\r\\nimportance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came\\r\\nback alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a\\r\\nmile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One\\r\\nwas an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was\\r\\nWilliam Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both\\r\\nthese witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The\\r\\ngame-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.\\r\\nMcCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the\\r\\nsame way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the\\r\\nfather was actually in sight at the time, and the son was\\r\\nfollowing him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in\\r\\nthe evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,\\r\\nthe game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly\\r\\nwooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the\\r\\nedge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of\\r\\nthe lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the\\r\\nwoods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she\\r\\nsaw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.\\r\\nMcCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a\\r\\nviolent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very\\r\\nstrong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\\r\\nhand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\\r\\nviolence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached\\r\\nhome that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near\\r\\nBoscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to\\r\\nfight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came\\r\\nrunning up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead\\r\\nin the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was\\r\\nmuch excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right\\r\\nhand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On\\r\\nfollowing him they found the dead body stretched out upon the\\r\\ngrass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\\r\\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\\r\\nmight very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\\'s\\r\\ngun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the\\r\\nbody. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly\\r\\narrested, and a verdict of \\'wilful murder\\' having been returned\\r\\nat the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the\\r\\nmagistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next\\r\\nAssizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out\\r\\nbefore the coroner and the police-court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could hardly imagine a more damning case,\" I remarked. \"If\\r\\never circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so\\r\\nhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\" answered Holmes\\r\\nthoughtfully. \"It may seem to point very straight to one thing,\\r\\nbut if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it\\r\\npointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something\\r\\nentirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case\\r\\nlooks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very\\r\\npossible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people\\r\\nin the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the\\r\\ndaughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his\\r\\ninnocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect\\r\\nin connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in\\r\\nhis interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the\\r\\ncase to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are\\r\\nflying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly\\r\\ndigesting their breakfasts at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid,\" said I, \"that the facts are so obvious that you\\r\\nwill find little credit to be gained out of this case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\" he\\r\\nanswered, laughing. \"Besides, we may chance to hit upon some\\r\\nother obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to\\r\\nMr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting\\r\\nwhen I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by\\r\\nmeans which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of\\r\\nunderstanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\\r\\nperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand\\r\\nside, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted\\r\\neven so self-evident a thing as that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How on earth--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness\\r\\nwhich characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this\\r\\nseason you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less\\r\\nand less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until\\r\\nit becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the\\r\\njaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated\\r\\nthan the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking\\r\\nat himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a\\r\\nresult. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and\\r\\ninference. Therein lies my m\\xe9tier, and it is just possible that\\r\\nit may be of some service in the investigation which lies before\\r\\nus. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in\\r\\nthe inquest, and which are worth considering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are they?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after\\r\\nthe return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary\\r\\ninforming him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not\\r\\nsurprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.\\r\\nThis observation of his had the natural effect of removing any\\r\\ntraces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the\\r\\ncoroner\\'s jury.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a confession,\" I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at\\r\\nleast a most suspicious remark.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary,\" said Holmes, \"it is the brightest rift which I\\r\\ncan at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,\\r\\nhe could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the\\r\\ncircumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared\\r\\nsurprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I\\r\\nshould have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such\\r\\nsurprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,\\r\\nand yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His\\r\\nfrank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent\\r\\nman, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and\\r\\nfirmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\\r\\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of\\r\\nhis father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\\r\\nso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and\\r\\neven, according to the little girl whose evidence is so\\r\\nimportant, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The\\r\\nself-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark\\r\\nappear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a\\r\\nguilty one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head. \"Many men have been hanged on far slighter\\r\\nevidence,\" I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the young man\\'s own account of the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,\\r\\nthough there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.\\r\\nYou will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire\\r\\npaper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the\\r\\nparagraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own\\r\\nstatement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the\\r\\ncorner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this\\r\\nway:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called\\r\\nand gave evidence as follows: \\'I had been away from home for\\r\\nthree days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the\\r\\nmorning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at\\r\\nthe time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he\\r\\nhad driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after\\r\\nmy return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,\\r\\nlooking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out\\r\\nof the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was\\r\\ngoing. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of\\r\\nthe Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit\\r\\nwarren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William\\r\\nCrowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but\\r\\nhe is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had\\r\\nno idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards\\r\\nfrom the pool I heard a cry of \"Cooee!\" which was a usual signal\\r\\nbetween my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found\\r\\nhim standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at\\r\\nseeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A\\r\\nconversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,\\r\\nfor my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his\\r\\npassion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned\\r\\ntowards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\\r\\nhowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me\\r\\nto run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,\\r\\nwith his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in\\r\\nmy arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for\\r\\nsome minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner\\'s lodge-keeper,\\r\\nhis house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one\\r\\nnear my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by\\r\\nhis injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and\\r\\nforbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no\\r\\nactive enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before\\r\\nhe died?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some\\r\\nallusion to a rat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was\\r\\ndelirious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father\\r\\nhad this final quarrel?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can\\r\\nassure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which\\r\\nfollowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point\\r\\nout to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case\\r\\nconsiderably in any future proceedings which may arise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness: I must still refuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of \\'Cooee\\' was a common\\r\\nsignal between you and your father?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness: It was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw\\r\\nyou, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions\\r\\nwhen you returned on hearing the cry and found your father\\r\\nfatally injured?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness: Nothing definite.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Coroner: What do you mean?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into\\r\\nthe open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet\\r\\nI have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay\\r\\nupon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be\\r\\nsomething grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.\\r\\nWhen I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was\\r\\ngone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, it was gone.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You cannot say what it was?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No, I had a feeling something was there.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'How far from the body?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'A dozen yards or so.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And how far from the edge of the wood?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'About the same.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen\\r\\nyards of it?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, but with my back towards it.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This concluded the examination of the witness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see,\" said I as I glanced down the column, \"that the coroner\\r\\nin his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.\\r\\nHe calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his\\r\\nfather having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his\\r\\nrefusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and\\r\\nhis singular account of his father\\'s dying words. They are all,\\r\\nas he remarks, very much against the son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon\\r\\nthe cushioned seat. \"Both you and the coroner have been at some\\r\\npains,\" said he, \"to single out the very strongest points in the\\r\\nyoung man\\'s favour. Don\\'t you see that you alternately give him\\r\\ncredit for having too much imagination and too little? Too\\r\\nlittle, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would\\r\\ngive him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from\\r\\nhis own inner consciousness anything so outr\\xe9 as a dying\\r\\nreference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,\\r\\nsir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what\\r\\nthis young man says is true, and we shall see whither that\\r\\nhypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\\r\\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the\\r\\nscene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be\\r\\nthere in twenty minutes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly four o\\'clock when we at last, after passing through\\r\\nthe beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,\\r\\nfound ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A\\r\\nlean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for\\r\\nus upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and\\r\\nleather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic\\r\\nsurroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of\\r\\nScotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a\\r\\nroom had already been engaged for us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have ordered a carriage,\" said Lestrade as we sat over a cup\\r\\nof tea. \"I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be\\r\\nhappy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very nice and complimentary of you,\" Holmes answered. \"It\\r\\nis entirely a question of barometric pressure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade looked startled. \"I do not quite follow,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud\\r\\nin the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need\\r\\nsmoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country\\r\\nhotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I\\r\\nshall use the carriage to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \"You have, no doubt, already formed\\r\\nyour conclusions from the newspapers,\" he said. \"The case is as\\r\\nplain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer\\r\\nit becomes. Still, of course, one can\\'t refuse a lady, and such a\\r\\nvery positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your\\r\\nopinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing\\r\\nwhich you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my\\r\\nsoul! here is her carriage at the door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the\\r\\nmost lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her\\r\\nviolet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her\\r\\ncheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her\\r\\noverpowering excitement and concern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" she cried, glancing from one to the\\r\\nother of us, and finally, with a woman\\'s quick intuition,\\r\\nfastening upon my companion, \"I am so glad that you have come. I\\r\\nhave driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn\\'t do it.\\r\\nI know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,\\r\\ntoo. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each\\r\\nother since we were little children, and I know his faults as no\\r\\none else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a\\r\\ncharge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\"You may rely upon my doing all that I can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?\\r\\nDo you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself\\r\\nthink that he is innocent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that it is very probable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There, now!\" she cried, throwing back her head and looking\\r\\ndefiantly at Lestrade. \"You hear! He gives me hopes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am afraid that my colleague\\r\\nhas been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did\\r\\nit. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the\\r\\nreason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because\\r\\nI was concerned in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In what way?\" asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had\\r\\nmany disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that\\r\\nthere should be a marriage between us. James and I have always\\r\\nloved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young\\r\\nand has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he\\r\\nnaturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there\\r\\nwere quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your father?\" asked Holmes. \"Was he in favour of such a\\r\\nunion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in\\r\\nfavour of it.\" A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as\\r\\nHolmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you for this information,\" said he. \"May I see your father\\r\\nif I call to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid the doctor won\\'t allow it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The doctor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for\\r\\nyears back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken\\r\\nto his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his\\r\\nnervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive\\r\\nwho had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! In Victoria! That is important.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, at the mines.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner\\r\\nmade his money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you\\r\\nwill go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do\\r\\ntell him that I know him to be innocent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, Miss Turner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if\\r\\nI leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\" She\\r\\nhurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we\\r\\nheard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am ashamed of you, Holmes,\" said Lestrade with dignity after a\\r\\nfew minutes\\' silence. \"Why should you raise up hopes which you\\r\\nare bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I\\r\\ncall it cruel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\" said\\r\\nHolmes. \"Have you an order to see him in prison?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but only for you and me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have\\r\\nstill time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ample.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very\\r\\nslow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through\\r\\nthe streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,\\r\\nwhere I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a\\r\\nyellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,\\r\\nhowever, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were\\r\\ngroping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the\\r\\naction to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and\\r\\ngave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the\\r\\nday. Supposing that this unhappy young man\\'s story were\\r\\nabsolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely\\r\\nunforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between\\r\\nthe time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,\\r\\ndrawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was\\r\\nsomething terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the\\r\\nnature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?\\r\\nI rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which\\r\\ncontained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\\'s\\r\\ndeposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left\\r\\nparietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\\r\\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot\\r\\nupon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from\\r\\nbehind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when\\r\\nseen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it\\r\\ndid not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his\\r\\nback before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call\\r\\nHolmes\\' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying\\r\\nreference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be\\r\\ndelirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become\\r\\ndelirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how\\r\\nhe met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my\\r\\nbrains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident\\r\\nof the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the\\r\\nmurderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\\r\\novercoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\\r\\nreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was\\r\\nkneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a\\r\\ntissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I\\r\\ndid not wonder at Lestrade\\'s opinion, and yet I had so much faith\\r\\nin Sherlock Holmes\\' insight that I could not lose hope as long\\r\\nas every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young\\r\\nMcCarthy\\'s innocence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,\\r\\nfor Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The glass still keeps very high,\" he remarked as he sat down.\\r\\n\"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able\\r\\nto go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his\\r\\nvery best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not\\r\\nwish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young\\r\\nMcCarthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did you learn from him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could he throw no light?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew\\r\\nwho had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced\\r\\nnow that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very\\r\\nquick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,\\r\\nsound at heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot admire his taste,\" I remarked, \"if it is indeed a fact\\r\\nthat he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as\\r\\nthis Miss Turner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\\r\\ninsanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was\\r\\nonly a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away\\r\\nfive years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get\\r\\ninto the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a\\r\\nregistry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can\\r\\nimagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not\\r\\ndoing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows\\r\\nto be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort\\r\\nwhich made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,\\r\\nat their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\\r\\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,\\r\\nand his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would\\r\\nhave thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with\\r\\nhis barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in\\r\\nBristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that\\r\\npoint. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,\\r\\nfor the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious\\r\\ntrouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and\\r\\nhas written to him to say that she has a husband already in the\\r\\nBermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I\\r\\nthink that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\\r\\nthat he has suffered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he is innocent, who has done it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two\\r\\npoints. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with\\r\\nsomeone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his\\r\\nson, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would\\r\\nreturn. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry\\r\\n\\'Cooee!\\' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the\\r\\ncrucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk\\r\\nabout George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all\\r\\nminor matters until to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke\\r\\nbright and cloudless. At nine o\\'clock Lestrade called for us with\\r\\nthe carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe\\r\\nPool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is serious news this morning,\" Lestrade observed. \"It is\\r\\nsaid that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is\\r\\ndespaired of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An elderly man, I presume?\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\\r\\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This\\r\\nbusiness has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend\\r\\nof McCarthy\\'s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I\\r\\nhave learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! That is interesting,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody\\r\\nabout here speaks of his kindness to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\\r\\nMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have\\r\\nbeen under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of\\r\\nmarrying his son to Turner\\'s daughter, who is, presumably,\\r\\nheiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,\\r\\nas if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would\\r\\nfollow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself\\r\\nwas averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not\\r\\ndeduce something from that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have got to the deductions and the inferences,\" said\\r\\nLestrade, winking at me. \"I find it hard enough to tackle facts,\\r\\nHolmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right,\" said Holmes demurely; \"you do find it very hard\\r\\nto tackle the facts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it\\r\\ndifficult to get hold of,\" replied Lestrade with some warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that is--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that\\r\\nall theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\" said Holmes,\\r\\nlaughing. \"But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley\\r\\nFarm upon the left.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that is it.\" It was a widespread, comfortable-looking\\r\\nbuilding, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches\\r\\nof lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless\\r\\nchimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight\\r\\nof this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,\\r\\nwhen the maid, at Holmes\\' request, showed us the boots which her\\r\\nmaster wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the\\r\\nson\\'s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured\\r\\nthese very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes\\r\\ndesired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed\\r\\nthe winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent\\r\\nas this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of\\r\\nBaker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed\\r\\nand darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,\\r\\nwhile his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.\\r\\nHis face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips\\r\\ncompressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,\\r\\nsinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal\\r\\nlust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated\\r\\nupon the matter before him that a question or remark fell\\r\\nunheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,\\r\\nimpatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way\\r\\nalong the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of\\r\\nthe woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is\\r\\nall that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon\\r\\nthe path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either\\r\\nside. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and\\r\\nonce he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and\\r\\nI walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,\\r\\nwhile I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the\\r\\nconviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a\\r\\ndefinite end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water\\r\\nsome fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the\\r\\nHatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.\\r\\nAbove the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see\\r\\nthe red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\\r\\nlandowner\\'s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods\\r\\ngrew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass\\r\\ntwenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds\\r\\nwhich lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which\\r\\nthe body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,\\r\\nthat I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the\\r\\nfall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\\r\\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read\\r\\nupon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking\\r\\nup a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you go into the pool for?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon\\r\\nor other trace. But how on earth--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its\\r\\ninward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and\\r\\nthere it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all\\r\\nhave been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo\\r\\nand wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the\\r\\nlodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or\\r\\neight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of\\r\\nthe same feet.\" He drew out a lens and lay down upon his\\r\\nwaterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to\\r\\nhimself than to us. \"These are young McCarthy\\'s feet. Twice he\\r\\nwas walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are\\r\\ndeeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\\r\\nstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are\\r\\nthe father\\'s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It\\r\\nis the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?\\r\\nHa, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite\\r\\nunusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course\\r\\nthat was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\" He ran up\\r\\nand down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we\\r\\nwere well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a\\r\\ngreat beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced\\r\\nhis way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\\r\\nhis face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he\\r\\nremained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,\\r\\ngathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\\r\\nexamining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of\\r\\nthe tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among\\r\\nthe moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then\\r\\nhe followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the\\r\\nhighroad, where all traces were lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been a case of considerable interest,\" he remarked,\\r\\nreturning to his natural manner. \"I fancy that this grey house on\\r\\nthe right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a\\r\\nword with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done\\r\\nthat, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,\\r\\nand I shall be with you presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove\\r\\nback into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he\\r\\nhad picked up in the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This may interest you, Lestrade,\" he remarked, holding it out.\\r\\n\"The murder was done with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see no marks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few\\r\\ndays. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It\\r\\ncorresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other\\r\\nweapon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the murderer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\\r\\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian\\r\\ncigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his\\r\\npocket. There are several other indications, but these may be\\r\\nenough to aid us in our search.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade laughed. \"I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a\\r\\nhard-headed British jury.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nous verrons,\" answered Holmes calmly. \"You work your own\\r\\nmethod, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,\\r\\nand shall probably return to London by the evening train.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And leave your case unfinished?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, finished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the mystery?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is solved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who was the criminal, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The gentleman I describe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But who is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\\r\\npopulous neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am a practical man,\" he said,\\r\\n\"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking\\r\\nfor a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the\\r\\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Holmes quietly. \"I have given you the chance.\\r\\nHere are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before\\r\\nI leave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where\\r\\nwe found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in\\r\\nthought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds\\r\\nhimself in a perplexing position.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, Watson,\" he said when the cloth was cleared \"just sit\\r\\ndown in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\\'t\\r\\nknow quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a\\r\\ncigar and let me expound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Pray do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about\\r\\nyoung McCarthy\\'s narrative which struck us both instantly,\\r\\nalthough they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One\\r\\nwas the fact that his father should, according to his account,\\r\\ncry \\'Cooee!\\' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying\\r\\nreference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but\\r\\nthat was all that caught the son\\'s ear. Now from this double\\r\\npoint our research must commence, and we will begin it by\\r\\npresuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What of this \\'Cooee!\\' then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The\\r\\nson, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that\\r\\nhe was within earshot. The \\'Cooee!\\' was meant to attract the\\r\\nattention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But\\r\\n\\'Cooee\\' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used\\r\\nbetween Australians. There is a strong presumption that the\\r\\nperson whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was\\r\\nsomeone who had been in Australia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What of the rat, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened\\r\\nit out on the table. \"This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\"\\r\\nhe said. \"I wired to Bristol for it last night.\" He put his hand\\r\\nover part of the map. \"What do you read?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"ARAT,\" I read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now?\" He raised his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"BALLARAT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his\\r\\nson only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter\\r\\nthe name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is wonderful!\" I exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\\r\\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point\\r\\nwhich, granting the son\\'s statement to be correct, was a\\r\\ncertainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite\\r\\nconception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only\\r\\nbe approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could\\r\\nhardly wander.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the\\r\\nground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that\\r\\nimbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how did you gain them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of\\r\\ntrifles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length\\r\\nof his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, they were peculiar boots.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But his lameness?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than\\r\\nhis left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he\\r\\nwas lame.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But his left-handedness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded\\r\\nby the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from\\r\\nimmediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can\\r\\nthat be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind\\r\\nthat tree during the interview between the father and son. He had\\r\\neven smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special\\r\\nknowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian\\r\\ncigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and\\r\\nwritten a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different\\r\\nvarieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the\\r\\nash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\\r\\nwhere he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety\\r\\nwhich are rolled in Rotterdam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the cigar-holder?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he\\r\\nused a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the\\r\\ncut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holmes,\" I said, \"you have drawn a net round this man from which\\r\\nhe cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as\\r\\ntruly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the\\r\\ndirection in which all this points. The culprit is--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. John Turner,\" cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of\\r\\nour sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His\\r\\nslow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of\\r\\ndecrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and\\r\\nhis enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual\\r\\nstrength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled\\r\\nhair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air\\r\\nof dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an\\r\\nashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were\\r\\ntinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that\\r\\nhe was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray sit down on the sofa,\" said Holmes gently. \"You had my\\r\\nnote?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to\\r\\nsee me here to avoid scandal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why did you wish to see me?\" He looked across at my\\r\\ncompanion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question\\r\\nwas already answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \"It\\r\\nis so. I know all about McCarthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \"God help me!\" he cried.\\r\\n\"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you\\r\\nmy word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at\\r\\nthe Assizes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad to hear you say so,\" said Holmes gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It\\r\\nwould break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears\\r\\nthat I am arrested.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may not come to that,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter\\r\\nwho required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.\\r\\nYoung McCarthy must be got off, however.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am a dying man,\" said old Turner. \"I have had diabetes for\\r\\nyears. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a\\r\\nmonth. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand\\r\\nand a bundle of paper before him. \"Just tell us the truth,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson\\r\\nhere can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the\\r\\nlast extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall\\r\\nnot use it unless it is absolutely needed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s as well,\" said the old man; \"it\\'s a question whether I\\r\\nshall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I\\r\\nshould wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the\\r\\nthing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but\\r\\nwill not take me long to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You didn\\'t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil\\r\\nincarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of\\r\\nsuch a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,\\r\\nand he has blasted my life. I\\'ll tell you first how I came to be\\r\\nin his power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was in the early \\'60\\'s at the diggings. I was a young chap\\r\\nthen, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at\\r\\nanything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck\\r\\nwith my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you\\r\\nwould call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and\\r\\nwe had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time\\r\\nto time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.\\r\\nBlack Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party\\r\\nis still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and\\r\\nwe lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers\\r\\nand six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of\\r\\ntheir saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,\\r\\nhowever, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of\\r\\nthe wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the\\r\\nLord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his\\r\\nwicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every\\r\\nfeature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made\\r\\nour way over to England without being suspected. There I parted\\r\\nfrom my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and\\r\\nrespectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in\\r\\nthe market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,\\r\\nto make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,\\r\\nand though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.\\r\\nEven when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down\\r\\nthe right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned\\r\\nover a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was\\r\\ngoing well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in\\r\\nRegent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his\\r\\nfoot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Here we are, Jack,\\' says he, touching me on the arm; \\'we\\'ll be\\r\\nas good as a family to you. There\\'s two of us, me and my son, and\\r\\nyou can have the keeping of us. If you don\\'t--it\\'s a fine,\\r\\nlaw-abiding country is England, and there\\'s always a policeman\\r\\nwithin hail.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking\\r\\nthem off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land\\r\\never since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;\\r\\nturn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my\\r\\nelbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more\\r\\nafraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he\\r\\nwanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without\\r\\nquestion, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing\\r\\nwhich I could not give. He asked for Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was\\r\\nknown to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that\\r\\nhis lad should step into the whole property. But there I was\\r\\nfirm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that\\r\\nI had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that\\r\\nwas enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do\\r\\nhis worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses\\r\\nto talk it over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I\\r\\nsmoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.\\r\\nBut as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in\\r\\nme seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my\\r\\ndaughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she\\r\\nwere a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I\\r\\nand all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a\\r\\nman as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and\\r\\na desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,\\r\\nI knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!\\r\\nBoth could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I\\r\\ndid it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,\\r\\nI have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl\\r\\nshould be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\\r\\nthan I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction\\r\\nthan if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought\\r\\nback his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I\\r\\nwas forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in\\r\\nmy flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that\\r\\noccurred.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it is not for me to judge you,\" said Holmes as the old man\\r\\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. \"I pray that we\\r\\nmay never be exposed to such a temptation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you\\r\\nwill soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the\\r\\nAssizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is\\r\\ncondemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be\\r\\nseen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or\\r\\ndead, shall be safe with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Farewell, then,\" said the old man solemnly. \"Your own deathbeds,\\r\\nwhen they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace\\r\\nwhich you have given to mine.\" Tottering and shaking in all his\\r\\ngiant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God help us!\" said Holmes after a long silence. \"Why does fate\\r\\nplay such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such\\r\\na case as this that I do not think of Baxter\\'s words, and say,\\r\\n\\'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a\\r\\nnumber of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and\\r\\nsubmitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven\\r\\nmonths after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is\\r\\nevery prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily\\r\\ntogether in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their\\r\\npast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes\\r\\ncases between the years \\'82 and \\'90, I am faced by so many which\\r\\npresent strange and interesting features that it is no easy\\r\\nmatter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,\\r\\nhave already gained publicity through the papers, and others have\\r\\nnot offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend\\r\\npossessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of\\r\\nthese papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his\\r\\nanalytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without\\r\\nan ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and\\r\\nhave their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and\\r\\nsurmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\\r\\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable\\r\\nin its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted\\r\\nto give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are\\r\\npoints in connection with it which never have been, and probably\\r\\nnever will be, entirely cleared up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year \\'87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater\\r\\nor less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my\\r\\nheadings under this one twelve months I find an account of the\\r\\nadventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant\\r\\nSociety, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a\\r\\nfurniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the\\r\\nBritish barque \"Sophy Anderson\", of the singular adventures of the\\r\\nGrice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the\\r\\nCamberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\\'s watch, to\\r\\nprove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\\r\\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a\\r\\ndeduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the\\r\\ncase. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of\\r\\nthem present such singular features as the strange train of\\r\\ncircumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales\\r\\nhad set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had\\r\\nscreamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that\\r\\neven here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced\\r\\nto raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and\\r\\nto recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which\\r\\nshriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like\\r\\nuntamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew\\r\\nhigher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in\\r\\nthe chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\\r\\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the\\r\\nother was deep in one of Clark Russell\\'s fine sea-stories until\\r\\nthe howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,\\r\\nand the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of\\r\\nthe sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother\\'s, and for a\\r\\nfew days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker\\r\\nStreet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said I, glancing up at my companion, \"that was surely the\\r\\nbell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except yourself I have none,\" he answered. \"I do not encourage\\r\\nvisitors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A client, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out\\r\\non such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more\\r\\nlikely to be some crony of the landlady\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there\\r\\ncame a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He\\r\\nstretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and\\r\\ntowards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in!\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the\\r\\noutside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of\\r\\nrefinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella\\r\\nwhich he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told\\r\\nof the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about\\r\\nhim anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his\\r\\nface was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is\\r\\nweighed down with some great anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I owe you an apology,\" he said, raising his golden pince-nez to\\r\\nhis eyes. \"I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have\\r\\nbrought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug\\r\\nchamber.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me your coat and umbrella,\" said Holmes. \"They may rest\\r\\nhere on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from\\r\\nthe south-west, I see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, from Horsham.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is\\r\\nquite distinctive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come for advice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is easily got.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not always so easy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast\\r\\nhow you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He said that you could solve anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He said too much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you are never beaten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is true that I have been generally successful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you may be so with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me\\r\\nwith some details as to your case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no ordinary one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of\\r\\nappeal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you\\r\\nhave ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of\\r\\nevents than those which have happened in my own family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You fill me with interest,\" said Holmes. \"Pray give us the\\r\\nessential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards\\r\\nquestion you as to those details which seem to me to be most\\r\\nimportant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out\\r\\ntowards the blaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My name,\" said he, \"is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,\\r\\nas far as I can understand, little to do with this awful\\r\\nbusiness. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an\\r\\nidea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the\\r\\naffair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias\\r\\nand my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,\\r\\nwhich he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He\\r\\nwas a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business\\r\\nmet with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire\\r\\nupon a handsome competence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and\\r\\nbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done\\r\\nvery well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\\'s army,\\r\\nand afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When\\r\\nLee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where\\r\\nhe remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came\\r\\nback to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.\\r\\nHe had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his\\r\\nreason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his\\r\\ndislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to\\r\\nthem. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very\\r\\nfoul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\\r\\ndisposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I\\r\\ndoubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or\\r\\nthree fields round his house, and there he would take his\\r\\nexercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave\\r\\nhis room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very\\r\\nheavily, but he would see no society and did not want any\\r\\nfriends, not even his own brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He didn\\'t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the\\r\\ntime when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This\\r\\nwould be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years\\r\\nin England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he\\r\\nwas very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be\\r\\nfond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would\\r\\nmake me his representative both with the servants and with the\\r\\ntradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite\\r\\nmaster of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I\\r\\nliked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in\\r\\nhis privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he\\r\\nhad a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was\\r\\ninvariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or\\r\\nanyone else to enter. With a boy\\'s curiosity I have peeped\\r\\nthrough the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a\\r\\ncollection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such\\r\\na room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp\\r\\nlay upon the table in front of the colonel\\'s plate. It was not a\\r\\ncommon thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all\\r\\npaid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \\'From\\r\\nIndia!\\' said he as he took it up, \\'Pondicherry postmark! What can\\r\\nthis be?\\' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little\\r\\ndried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to\\r\\nlaugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight\\r\\nof his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\\r\\nskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he\\r\\nstill held in his trembling hand, \\'K. K. K.!\\' he shrieked, and\\r\\nthen, \\'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What is it, uncle?\\' I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Death,\\' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his\\r\\nroom, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope\\r\\nand saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the\\r\\ngum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else\\r\\nsave the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his\\r\\noverpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I\\r\\nascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,\\r\\nwhich must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small\\r\\nbrass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'They may do what they like, but I\\'ll checkmate them still,\\'\\r\\nsaid he with an oath. \\'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my\\r\\nroom to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to\\r\\nstep up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the\\r\\ngrate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned\\r\\npaper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I\\r\\nglanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was\\r\\nprinted the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the\\r\\nenvelope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I wish you, John,\\' said my uncle, \\'to witness my will. I leave\\r\\nmy estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to\\r\\nmy brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to\\r\\nyou. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you\\r\\ncannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest\\r\\nenemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can\\'t\\r\\nsay what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper\\r\\nwhere Mr. Fordham shows you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with\\r\\nhim. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest\\r\\nimpression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every\\r\\nway in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I\\r\\ncould not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left\\r\\nbehind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed\\r\\nand nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I\\r\\ncould see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,\\r\\nand he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his\\r\\ntime he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the\\r\\ninside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy\\r\\nand would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a\\r\\nrevolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,\\r\\nand that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by\\r\\nman or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would\\r\\nrush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,\\r\\nlike a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror\\r\\nwhich lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen\\r\\nhis face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it\\r\\nwere new raised from a basin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to\\r\\nabuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those\\r\\ndrunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when\\r\\nwe went to search for him, face downward in a little\\r\\ngreen-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There\\r\\nwas no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,\\r\\nso that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,\\r\\nbrought in a verdict of \\'suicide.\\' But I, who knew how he winced\\r\\nfrom the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself\\r\\nthat he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\\r\\nhowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and\\r\\nof some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One moment,\" Holmes interposed, \"your statement is, I foresee,\\r\\none of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me\\r\\nhave the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and\\r\\nthe date of his supposed suicide.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks\\r\\nlater, upon the night of May 2nd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. Pray proceed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my\\r\\nrequest, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been\\r\\nalways locked up. We found the brass box there, although its\\r\\ncontents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a\\r\\npaper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and\\r\\n\\'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\\' written beneath.\\r\\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had\\r\\nbeen destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\\r\\nnothing of much importance in the attic save a great many\\r\\nscattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\\'s life in\\r\\nAmerica. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had\\r\\ndone his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.\\r\\nOthers were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern\\r\\nstates, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had\\r\\nevidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag\\r\\npoliticians who had been sent down from the North.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it was the beginning of \\'84 when my father came to live at\\r\\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the\\r\\nJanuary of \\'85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my\\r\\nfather give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the\\r\\nbreakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened\\r\\nenvelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the\\r\\noutstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what\\r\\nhe called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked\\r\\nvery scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\\' he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My heart had turned to lead. \\'It is K. K. K.,\\' said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He looked inside the envelope. \\'So it is,\\' he cried. \\'Here are\\r\\nthe very letters. But what is this written above them?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Put the papers on the sundial,\\' I read, peeping over his\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What papers? What sundial?\\' he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\\' said I; \\'but the\\r\\npapers must be those that are destroyed.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Pooh!\\' said he, gripping hard at his courage. \\'We are in a\\r\\ncivilised land here, and we can\\'t have tomfoolery of this kind.\\r\\nWhere does the thing come from?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'From Dundee,\\' I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Some preposterous practical joke,\\' said he. \\'What have I to do\\r\\nwith sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such\\r\\nnonsense.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I should certainly speak to the police,\\' I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Then let me do so?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No, I forbid you. I won\\'t have a fuss made about such\\r\\nnonsense.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate\\r\\nman. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of\\r\\nforebodings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went\\r\\nfrom home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is\\r\\nin command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad\\r\\nthat he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from\\r\\ndanger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in\\r\\nerror. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram\\r\\nfrom the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had\\r\\nfallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the\\r\\nneighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I\\r\\nhurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered\\r\\nhis consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from\\r\\nFareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,\\r\\nand the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in\\r\\nbringing in a verdict of \\'death from accidental causes.\\'\\r\\nCarefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I\\r\\nwas unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of\\r\\nmurder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\\r\\nrobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.\\r\\nAnd yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,\\r\\nand that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been\\r\\nwoven round him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me\\r\\nwhy I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well\\r\\nconvinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an\\r\\nincident in my uncle\\'s life, and that the danger would be as\\r\\npressing in one house as in another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was in January, \\'85, that my poor father met his end, and two\\r\\nyears and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time\\r\\nI have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that\\r\\nthis curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended\\r\\nwith the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,\\r\\nhowever; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in\\r\\nwhich it had come upon my father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and\\r\\nturning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried\\r\\norange pips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the envelope,\" he continued. \"The postmark is\\r\\nLondon--eastern division. Within are the very words which were\\r\\nupon my father\\'s last message: \\'K. K. K.\\'; and then \\'Put the\\r\\npapers on the sundial.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have you done?\" asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To tell the truth\"--he sank his face into his thin, white\\r\\nhands--\"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor\\r\\nrabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in\\r\\nthe grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight\\r\\nand no precautions can guard against.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tut! tut!\" cried Sherlock Holmes. \"You must act, man, or you are\\r\\nlost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for\\r\\ndespair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen the police.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that\\r\\nthe inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all\\r\\npractical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really\\r\\naccidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with\\r\\nthe warnings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \"Incredible\\r\\nimbecility!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in\\r\\nthe house with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has he come with you to-night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. His orders were to stay in the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you come to me,\" he cried, \"and, above all, why did you\\r\\nnot come at once?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major\\r\\nPrendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have\\r\\nacted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than\\r\\nthat which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which\\r\\nmight help us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is one thing,\" said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\\r\\npocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted\\r\\npaper, he laid it out upon the table. \"I have some remembrance,\"\\r\\nsaid he, \"that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I\\r\\nobserved that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the\\r\\nashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet\\r\\nupon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it\\r\\nmay be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from\\r\\namong the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond\\r\\nthe mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think\\r\\nmyself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is\\r\\nundoubtedly my uncle\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,\\r\\nwhich showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from\\r\\na book. It was headed, \"March, 1869,\" and beneath were the\\r\\nfollowing enigmatical notices:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and\\r\\n      John Swain, of St. Augustine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"9th. McCauley cleared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"10th. John Swain cleared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you!\" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it\\r\\nto our visitor. \"And now you must on no account lose another\\r\\ninstant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told\\r\\nme. You must get home instantly and act.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What shall I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must\\r\\nput this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass\\r\\nbox which you have described. You must also put in a note to say\\r\\nthat all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that\\r\\nthis is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such\\r\\nwords as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you\\r\\nmust at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do\\r\\nyou understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I\\r\\nthink that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our\\r\\nweb to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first\\r\\nconsideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens\\r\\nyou. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the\\r\\nguilty parties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you,\" said the young man, rising and pulling on his\\r\\novercoat. \"You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall\\r\\ncertainly do as you advise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in\\r\\nthe meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that\\r\\nyou are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you\\r\\ngo back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By train from Waterloo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that\\r\\nyou may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too\\r\\nclosely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am armed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall see you at Horsham, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news\\r\\nas to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every\\r\\nparticular.\" He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside\\r\\nthe wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered\\r\\nagainst the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come\\r\\nto us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet\\r\\nof sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them\\r\\nonce more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk\\r\\nforward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he\\r\\nlit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue\\r\\nsmoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think, Watson,\" he remarked at last, \"that of all our cases we\\r\\nhave had none more fantastic than this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems\\r\\nto me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the\\r\\nSholtos.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But have you,\" I asked, \"formed any definite conception as to\\r\\nwhat these perils are?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no question as to their nature,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue\\r\\nthis unhappy family?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the\\r\\narms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \"The ideal\\r\\nreasoner,\" he remarked, \"would, when he had once been shown a\\r\\nsingle fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the\\r\\nchain of events which led up to it but also all the results which\\r\\nwould follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole\\r\\nanimal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who\\r\\nhas thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents\\r\\nshould be able to accurately state all the other ones, both\\r\\nbefore and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the\\r\\nreason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study\\r\\nwhich have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the\\r\\naid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest\\r\\npitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to\\r\\nutilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this\\r\\nin itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all\\r\\nknowledge, which, even in these days of free education and\\r\\nencyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so\\r\\nimpossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge\\r\\nwhich is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have\\r\\nendeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one\\r\\noccasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits\\r\\nin a very precise fashion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" I answered, laughing. \"It was a singular document.\\r\\nPhilosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I\\r\\nremember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the\\r\\nmud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry\\r\\neccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime\\r\\nrecords unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and\\r\\nself-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the\\r\\nmain points of my analysis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \"Well,\" he said, \"I say now, as\\r\\nI said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic\\r\\nstocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the\\r\\nrest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he\\r\\ncan get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which\\r\\nhas been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster\\r\\nall our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the\\r\\n\\'American Encyclopaedia\\' which stands upon the shelf beside you.\\r\\nThank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be\\r\\ndeduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong\\r\\npresumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for\\r\\nleaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their\\r\\nhabits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for\\r\\nthe lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love\\r\\nof solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of\\r\\nsomeone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis\\r\\nthat it was fear of someone or something which drove him from\\r\\nAmerica. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by\\r\\nconsidering the formidable letters which were received by himself\\r\\nand his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those\\r\\nletters?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the\\r\\nthird from London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From East London. What do you deduce from that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that\\r\\nthe probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was\\r\\non board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the\\r\\ncase of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and\\r\\nits fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.\\r\\nDoes that suggest anything?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A greater distance to travel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the letter had also a greater distance to come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I do not see the point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man\\r\\nor men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send\\r\\ntheir singular warning or token before them when starting upon\\r\\ntheir mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign\\r\\nwhen it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a\\r\\nsteamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.\\r\\nBut, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those\\r\\nseven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which\\r\\nbrought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the\\r\\nwriter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly\\r\\nurgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to\\r\\ncaution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which\\r\\nit would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one\\r\\ncomes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God!\" I cried. \"What can it mean, this relentless\\r\\npersecution?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital\\r\\nimportance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think\\r\\nthat it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.\\r\\nA single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way\\r\\nas to deceive a coroner\\'s jury. There must have been several in\\r\\nit, and they must have been men of resource and determination.\\r\\nTheir papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.\\r\\nIn this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an\\r\\nindividual and becomes the badge of a society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But of what society?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you never--\" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and\\r\\nsinking his voice--\"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \"Here it\\r\\nis,\" said he presently:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to\\r\\nthe sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret\\r\\nsociety was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the\\r\\nSouthern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local\\r\\nbranches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,\\r\\nLouisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was\\r\\nused for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of\\r\\nthe negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country\\r\\nof those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually\\r\\npreceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic\\r\\nbut generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some\\r\\nparts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this\\r\\nthe victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might\\r\\nfly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would\\r\\nunfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and\\r\\nunforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the\\r\\nsociety, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a\\r\\ncase upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with\\r\\nimpunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the\\r\\nperpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite\\r\\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better\\r\\nclasses of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year\\r\\n1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have\\r\\nbeen sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will observe,\" said Holmes, laying down the volume, \"that\\r\\nthe sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the\\r\\ndisappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may\\r\\nwell have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his\\r\\nfamily have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.\\r\\nYou can understand that this register and diary may implicate\\r\\nsome of the first men in the South, and that there may be many\\r\\nwho will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the page we have seen--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \\'sent\\r\\nthe pips to A, B, and C\\'--that is, sent the society\\'s warning to\\r\\nthem. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or\\r\\nleft the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a\\r\\nsinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let\\r\\nsome light into this dark place, and I believe that the only\\r\\nchance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have\\r\\ntold him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done\\r\\nto-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for\\r\\nhalf an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable\\r\\nways of our fellow-men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a\\r\\nsubdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the\\r\\ngreat city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will excuse me for not waiting for you,\" said he; \"I have, I\\r\\nforesee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of\\r\\nyoung Openshaw\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What steps will you take?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.\\r\\nI may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will not go there first?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the\\r\\nmaid will bring up your coffee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and\\r\\nglanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a\\r\\nchill to my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holmes,\" I cried, \"you are too late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said he, laying down his cup, \"I feared as much. How was it\\r\\ndone?\" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading \\'Tragedy\\r\\nNear Waterloo Bridge.\\' Here is the account:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H\\r\\nDivision, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and\\r\\na splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and\\r\\nstormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it\\r\\nwas quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was\\r\\ngiven, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was\\r\\neventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman\\r\\nwhose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his\\r\\npocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.\\r\\nIt is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch\\r\\nthe last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and\\r\\nthe extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge\\r\\nof one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body\\r\\nexhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that\\r\\nthe deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,\\r\\nwhich should have the effect of calling the attention of the\\r\\nauthorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and\\r\\nshaken than I had ever seen him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That hurts my pride, Watson,\" he said at last. \"It is a petty\\r\\nfeeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal\\r\\nmatter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my\\r\\nhand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that\\r\\nI should send him away to his death--!\" He sprang from his chair\\r\\nand paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a\\r\\nflush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and\\r\\nunclasping of his long thin hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They must be cunning devils,\" he exclaimed at last. \"How could\\r\\nthey have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the\\r\\ndirect line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too\\r\\ncrowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,\\r\\nwe shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the police?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may\\r\\ntake the flies, but not before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in\\r\\nthe evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes\\r\\nhad not come back yet. It was nearly ten o\\'clock before he\\r\\nentered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,\\r\\nand tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,\\r\\nwashing it down with a long draught of water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are hungry,\" I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\\r\\nbreakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how have you succeeded?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a clue?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not\\r\\nlong remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish\\r\\ntrade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he\\r\\nsqueezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and\\r\\nthrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote\\r\\n\"S. H. for J. O.\" Then he sealed it and addressed it to \"Captain\\r\\nJames Calhoun, Barque \\'Lone Star,\\' Savannah, Georgia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will await him when he enters port,\" said he, chuckling.\\r\\n\"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a\\r\\nprecursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who is this Captain Calhoun?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you trace it, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with\\r\\ndates and names.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have spent the whole day,\" said he, \"over Lloyd\\'s registers\\r\\nand files of the old papers, following the future career of every\\r\\nvessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in\\r\\n\\'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were\\r\\nreported there during those months. Of these, one, the \\'Lone Star,\\'\\r\\ninstantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported\\r\\nas having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to\\r\\none of the states of the Union.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Texas, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must\\r\\nhave an American origin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque\\r\\n\\'Lone Star\\' was there in January, \\'85, my suspicion became a\\r\\ncertainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present\\r\\nin the port of London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The \\'Lone Star\\' had arrived here last week. I went down to the\\r\\nAlbert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by\\r\\nthe early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired\\r\\nto Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and\\r\\nas the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the\\r\\nGoodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What will you do, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I\\r\\nlearn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are\\r\\nFinns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away\\r\\nfrom the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has\\r\\nbeen loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship\\r\\nreaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and\\r\\nthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these\\r\\nthree gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,\\r\\nand the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the\\r\\norange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as\\r\\nresolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very\\r\\nsevere were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for\\r\\nnews of the \"Lone Star\" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We\\r\\ndid at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a\\r\\nshattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough\\r\\nof a wave, with the letters \"L. S.\" carved upon it, and that is\\r\\nall which we shall ever know of the fate of the \"Lone Star.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\\r\\n\\r\\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal\\r\\nof the Theological College of St. George\\'s, was much addicted to\\r\\nopium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some\\r\\nfoolish freak when he was at college; for having read De\\r\\nQuincey\\'s description of his dreams and sensations, he had\\r\\ndrenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the\\r\\nsame effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the\\r\\npractice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many\\r\\nyears he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of\\r\\nmingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see\\r\\nhim now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point\\r\\npupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night--it was in June, \\'89--there came a ring to my bell,\\r\\nabout the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the\\r\\nclock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work\\r\\ndown in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A patient!\" said she. \"You\\'ll have to go out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps\\r\\nupon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in\\r\\nsome dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will excuse my calling so late,\" she began, and then,\\r\\nsuddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms\\r\\nabout my wife\\'s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \"Oh, I\\'m in\\r\\nsuch trouble!\" she cried; \"I do so want a little help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said my wife, pulling up her veil, \"it is Kate Whitney.\\r\\nHow you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when\\r\\nyou came in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\" That was\\r\\nalways the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds\\r\\nto a light-house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine\\r\\nand water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or\\r\\nshould you rather that I sent James off to bed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor\\'s advice and help, too. It\\'s about\\r\\nIsa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about\\r\\nhim!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her\\r\\nhusband\\'s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend\\r\\nand school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words\\r\\nas we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it\\r\\npossible that we could bring him back to her?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late\\r\\nhe had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the\\r\\nfarthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been\\r\\nconfined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and\\r\\nshattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him\\r\\neight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the\\r\\ndregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the\\r\\neffects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar\\r\\nof Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could\\r\\nshe, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and\\r\\npluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of\\r\\nit. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second\\r\\nthought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\\'s medical\\r\\nadviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it\\r\\nbetter if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would\\r\\nsend him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the\\r\\naddress which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left\\r\\nmy armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding\\r\\neastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at\\r\\nthe time, though the future only could show how strange it was to\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my\\r\\nadventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the\\r\\nhigh wharves which line the north side of the river to the east\\r\\nof London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached\\r\\nby a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the\\r\\nmouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.\\r\\nOrdering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in\\r\\nthe centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the\\r\\nlight of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch\\r\\nand made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the\\r\\nbrown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\\r\\nforecastle of an emigrant ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying\\r\\nin strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads\\r\\nthrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a\\r\\ndark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black\\r\\nshadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,\\r\\nnow faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of\\r\\nthe metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to\\r\\nthemselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,\\r\\nmonotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then\\r\\nsuddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own\\r\\nthoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At\\r\\nthe farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside\\r\\nwhich on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old\\r\\nman, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon\\r\\nhis knees, staring into the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe\\r\\nfor me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. I have not come to stay,\" said I. \"There is a friend\\r\\nof mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and\\r\\npeering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and\\r\\nunkempt, staring out at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My God! It\\'s Watson,\" said he. He was in a pitiable state of\\r\\nreaction, with every nerve in a twitter. \"I say, Watson, what\\r\\no\\'clock is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nearly eleven.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of what day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of Friday, June 19th.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What\\r\\nd\\'you want to frighten a chap for?\" He sank his face onto his\\r\\narms and began to sob in a high treble key.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting\\r\\nthis two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I am. But you\\'ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here\\r\\na few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I\\'ll\\r\\ngo home with you. I wouldn\\'t frighten Kate--poor little Kate.\\r\\nGive me your hand! Have you a cab?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I have one waiting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I\\r\\nowe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of\\r\\nsleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying\\r\\nfumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed\\r\\nthe tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my\\r\\nskirt, and a low voice whispered, \"Walk past me, and then look\\r\\nback at me.\" The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I\\r\\nglanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my\\r\\nside, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very\\r\\nwrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between\\r\\nhis knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his\\r\\nfingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my\\r\\nself-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of\\r\\nastonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him\\r\\nbut I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull\\r\\neyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and\\r\\ngrinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He\\r\\nmade a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he\\r\\nturned his face half round to the company once more, subsided\\r\\ninto a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holmes!\" I whispered, \"what on earth are you doing in this den?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As low as you can,\" he answered; \"I have excellent ears. If you\\r\\nwould have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend\\r\\nof yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a cab outside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he\\r\\nappears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should\\r\\nrecommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to\\r\\nsay that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait\\r\\noutside, I shall be with you in five minutes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\\' requests, for\\r\\nthey were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with\\r\\nsuch a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney\\r\\nwas once confined in the cab my mission was practically\\r\\naccomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better\\r\\nthan to be associated with my friend in one of those singular\\r\\nadventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a\\r\\nfew minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\\'s bill, led him\\r\\nout to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a\\r\\nvery short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,\\r\\nand I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two\\r\\nstreets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.\\r\\nThen, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and\\r\\nburst into a hearty fit of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose, Watson,\" said he, \"that you imagine that I have added\\r\\nopium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little\\r\\nweaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical\\r\\nviews.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly surprised to find you there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But not more so than I to find you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I came to find a friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I to find an enemy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An enemy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural\\r\\nprey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable\\r\\ninquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent\\r\\nramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been\\r\\nrecognised in that den my life would not have been worth an\\r\\nhour\\'s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own\\r\\npurposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have\\r\\nvengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that\\r\\nbuilding, near the corner of Paul\\'s Wharf, which could tell some\\r\\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless\\r\\nnights.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! You do not mean bodies?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds\\r\\nfor every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It\\r\\nis the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that\\r\\nNeville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our\\r\\ntrap should be here.\" He put his two forefingers between his\\r\\nteeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a\\r\\nsimilar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle\\r\\nof wheels and the clink of horses\\' hoofs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Watson,\" said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through\\r\\nthe gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from\\r\\nits side lanterns. \"You\\'ll come with me, won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I can be of use.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still\\r\\nmore so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Cedars?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair\\'s house. I am staying there while I\\r\\nconduct the inquiry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is it, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I am all in the dark.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you are. You\\'ll know all about it presently. Jump up\\r\\nhere. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here\\'s half a\\r\\ncrown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her\\r\\nhead. So long, then!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through\\r\\nthe endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which\\r\\nwidened gradually, until we were flying across a broad\\r\\nbalustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly\\r\\nbeneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and\\r\\nmortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of\\r\\nthe policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of\\r\\nrevellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a\\r\\nstar or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of\\r\\nthe clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\\r\\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat\\r\\nbeside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which\\r\\nseemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in\\r\\nupon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles,\\r\\nand were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban\\r\\nvillas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up\\r\\nhis pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he\\r\\nis acting for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\" said he. \"It makes\\r\\nyou quite invaluable as a companion. \\'Pon my word, it is a great\\r\\nthing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are\\r\\nnot over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear\\r\\nlittle woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You forget that I know nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before\\r\\nwe get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can\\r\\nget nothing to go upon. There\\'s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I\\r\\ncan\\'t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I\\'ll state the case\\r\\nclearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a\\r\\nspark where all is dark to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Proceed, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee\\r\\na gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have\\r\\nplenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very\\r\\nnicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made\\r\\nfriends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter\\r\\nof a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no\\r\\noccupation, but was interested in several companies and went into\\r\\ntown as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon\\r\\nStreet every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of\\r\\nage, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very\\r\\naffectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know\\r\\nhim. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far\\r\\nas we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while\\r\\nhe has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and\\r\\nCounties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money\\r\\ntroubles have been weighing upon his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier\\r\\nthan usual, remarking before he started that he had two important\\r\\ncommissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy\\r\\nhome a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife\\r\\nreceived a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his\\r\\ndeparture, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable\\r\\nvalue which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the\\r\\noffices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up\\r\\nin your London, you will know that the office of the company is\\r\\nin Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where\\r\\nyou found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for\\r\\nthe City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\\'s office,\\r\\ngot her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through\\r\\nSwandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me\\r\\nso far?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very clear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.\\r\\nClair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab,\\r\\nas she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.\\r\\nWhile she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly\\r\\nheard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her\\r\\nhusband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning\\r\\nto her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she\\r\\ndistinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly\\r\\nagitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then\\r\\nvanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that\\r\\nhe had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.\\r\\nOne singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\\r\\nalthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town\\r\\nin, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\\r\\nsteps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which\\r\\nyou found me to-night--and running through the front room she\\r\\nattempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At\\r\\nthe foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of\\r\\nwhom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who\\r\\nacts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled\\r\\nwith the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the\\r\\nlane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of\\r\\nconstables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The\\r\\ninspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the\\r\\ncontinued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to\\r\\nthe room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no\\r\\nsign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was\\r\\nno one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,\\r\\nit seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly\\r\\nswore that no one else had been in the front room during the\\r\\nafternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was\\r\\nstaggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had\\r\\nbeen deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box\\r\\nwhich lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell\\r\\na cascade of children\\'s bricks. It was the toy which he had\\r\\npromised to bring home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple\\r\\nshowed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.\\r\\nThe rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an\\r\\nabominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a\\r\\nsitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon\\r\\nthe back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom\\r\\nwindow is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered\\r\\nat high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The\\r\\nbedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On\\r\\nexamination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,\\r\\nand several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of\\r\\nthe bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were\\r\\nall the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of\\r\\nhis coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were\\r\\nthere. There were no signs of violence upon any of these\\r\\ngarments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St.\\r\\nClair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no\\r\\nother exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon\\r\\nthe sill gave little promise that he could save himself by\\r\\nswimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of\\r\\nthe tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately\\r\\nimplicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the\\r\\nvilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair\\'s story, he was\\r\\nknown to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few\\r\\nseconds of her husband\\'s appearance at the window, he could\\r\\nhardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence\\r\\nwas one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no\\r\\nknowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he\\r\\ncould not account in any way for the presence of the missing\\r\\ngentleman\\'s clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who\\r\\nlives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was\\r\\ncertainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.\\r\\nClair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which\\r\\nis familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a\\r\\nprofessional beggar, though in order to avoid the police\\r\\nregulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some\\r\\nlittle distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand\\r\\nside, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the\\r\\nwall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\\r\\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he\\r\\nis a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the\\r\\ngreasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I\\r\\nhave watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of\\r\\nmaking his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised\\r\\nat the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His\\r\\nappearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him\\r\\nwithout observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face\\r\\ndisfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has\\r\\nturned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a\\r\\npair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular\\r\\ncontrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid\\r\\nthe common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he\\r\\nis ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be\\r\\nthrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now\\r\\nlearn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been\\r\\nthe last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But a cripple!\" said I. \"What could he have done single-handed\\r\\nagainst a man in the prime of life?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in\\r\\nother respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.\\r\\nSurely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that\\r\\nweakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional\\r\\nstrength in the others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray continue your narrative.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the\\r\\nwindow, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her\\r\\npresence could be of no help to them in their investigations.\\r\\nInspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful\\r\\nexamination of the premises, but without finding anything which\\r\\nthrew any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not\\r\\narresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes\\r\\nduring which he might have communicated with his friend the\\r\\nLascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and\\r\\nsearched, without anything being found which could incriminate\\r\\nhim. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right\\r\\nshirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\\r\\ncut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from\\r\\nthere, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and\\r\\nthat the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from\\r\\nthe same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.\\r\\nNeville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in\\r\\nhis room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to\\r\\nMrs. St. Clair\\'s assertion that she had actually seen her husband\\r\\nat the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or\\r\\ndreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the\\r\\npolice-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in\\r\\nthe hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they\\r\\nhad feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\\'s coat, and not\\r\\nNeville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And\\r\\nwhat do you think they found in the pockets?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with\\r\\npennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It\\r\\nwas no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a\\r\\nhuman body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between\\r\\nthe wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the\\r\\nweighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked\\r\\naway into the river.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the\\r\\nroom. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose\\r\\nthat this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the\\r\\nwindow, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.\\r\\nWhat would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him\\r\\nthat he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize\\r\\nthe coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it\\r\\nwould occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little\\r\\ntime, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried\\r\\nto force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his\\r\\nLascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\\r\\nThere is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret\\r\\nhoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he\\r\\nstuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the\\r\\npockets to make sure of the coat\\'s sinking. He throws it out, and\\r\\nwould have done the same with the other garments had not he heard\\r\\nthe rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the\\r\\nwindow when the police appeared.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly sounds feasible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a\\r\\nbetter. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the\\r\\nstation, but it could not be shown that there had ever before\\r\\nbeen anything against him. He had for years been known as a\\r\\nprofessional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very\\r\\nquiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and\\r\\nthe questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was\\r\\ndoing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is\\r\\nhe now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are\\r\\nall as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot\\r\\nrecall any case within my experience which looked at the first\\r\\nglance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of\\r\\nevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great\\r\\ntown until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and\\r\\nwe rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.\\r\\nJust as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered\\r\\nvillages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are on the outskirts of Lee,\" said my companion. \"We have\\r\\ntouched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in\\r\\nMiddlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.\\r\\nSee that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside\\r\\nthat lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have\\r\\nlittle doubt, caught the clink of our horse\\'s feet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\" I\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.\\r\\nMrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and\\r\\nyou may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for\\r\\nmy friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have\\r\\nno news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its\\r\\nown grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\\'s head, and\\r\\nspringing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding\\r\\ngravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door\\r\\nflew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad\\r\\nin some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy\\r\\npink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure\\r\\noutlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one\\r\\nhalf-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head\\r\\nand face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\" she cried, \"well?\" And then, seeing that there were two\\r\\nof us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw\\r\\nthat my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No good news?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No bad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have\\r\\nhad a long day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to\\r\\nme in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it\\r\\npossible for me to bring him out and associate him with this\\r\\ninvestigation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am delighted to see you,\" said she, pressing my hand warmly.\\r\\n\"You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\\r\\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so\\r\\nsuddenly upon us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam,\" said I, \"I am an old campaigner, and if I were\\r\\nnot I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of\\r\\nany assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be\\r\\nindeed happy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said the lady as we entered a\\r\\nwell-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had\\r\\nbeen laid out, \"I should very much like to ask you one or two\\r\\nplain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain\\r\\nanswer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given\\r\\nto fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon what point?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.\\r\\n\"Frankly, now!\" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking\\r\\nkeenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Frankly, then, madam, I do not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think that he is dead?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Murdered?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t say that. Perhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And on what day did he meet his death?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On Monday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how\\r\\nit is that I have received a letter from him to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been\\r\\ngalvanised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" he roared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, to-day.\" She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of\\r\\npaper in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out\\r\\nupon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I\\r\\nhad left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The\\r\\nenvelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend\\r\\npostmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day\\r\\nbefore, for it was considerably after midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Coarse writing,\" murmured Holmes. \"Surely this is not your\\r\\nhusband\\'s writing, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but the enclosure is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go\\r\\nand inquire as to the address.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you tell that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried\\r\\nitself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that\\r\\nblotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight\\r\\noff, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This\\r\\nman has written the name, and there has then been a pause before\\r\\nhe wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not\\r\\nfamiliar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is\\r\\nnothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!\\r\\nthere has been an enclosure here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you are sure that this is your husband\\'s hand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of his hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual\\r\\nwriting, and yet I know it well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a\\r\\nhuge error which it may take some little time to rectify.\\r\\nWait in patience.--NEVILLE.\\' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf\\r\\nof a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in\\r\\nGravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been\\r\\ngummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been\\r\\nchewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband\\'s\\r\\nhand, madam?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None. Neville wrote those words.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,\\r\\nthe clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the\\r\\ndanger is over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.\\r\\nThe ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only\\r\\nposted to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If so, much may have happened between.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is\\r\\nwell with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I\\r\\nshould know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him\\r\\nlast he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room\\r\\nrushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that\\r\\nsomething had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such\\r\\na trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman\\r\\nmay be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical\\r\\nreasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong\\r\\npiece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband\\r\\nis alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away\\r\\nfrom you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very much so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was the window open?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then he might have called to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A call for help, you thought?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. He waved his hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the\\r\\nunexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you thought he was pulled back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He disappeared so suddenly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the\\r\\nroom?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and\\r\\nthe Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his\\r\\nordinary clothes on?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare\\r\\nthroat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about\\r\\nwhich I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little\\r\\nsupper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day\\r\\nto-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our\\r\\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary\\r\\nafter my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,\\r\\nwho, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for\\r\\ndays, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,\\r\\nrearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view\\r\\nuntil he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his\\r\\ndata were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now\\r\\npreparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and\\r\\nwaistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered\\r\\nabout the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from\\r\\nthe sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of\\r\\nEastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with\\r\\nan ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front\\r\\nof him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an\\r\\nold briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the\\r\\ncorner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,\\r\\nsilent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set\\r\\naquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he\\r\\nsat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found\\r\\nthe summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still\\r\\nbetween his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was\\r\\nfull of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of\\r\\nshag which I had seen upon the previous night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Awake, Watson?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Game for a morning drive?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the\\r\\nstable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\" He\\r\\nchuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed\\r\\na different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one\\r\\nwas stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly\\r\\nfinished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was\\r\\nputting in the horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to test a little theory of mine,\" said he, pulling on his\\r\\nboots. \"I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the\\r\\npresence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve\\r\\nto be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the\\r\\nkey of the affair now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And where is it?\" I asked, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the bathroom,\" he answered. \"Oh, yes, I am not joking,\" he\\r\\ncontinued, seeing my look of incredulity. \"I have just been\\r\\nthere, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this\\r\\nGladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will\\r\\nnot fit the lock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into\\r\\nthe bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and\\r\\ntrap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both\\r\\nsprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country\\r\\ncarts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but\\r\\nthe lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as\\r\\nsome city in a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been in some points a singular case,\" said Holmes,\\r\\nflicking the horse on into a gallop. \"I confess that I have been\\r\\nas blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than\\r\\nnever to learn it at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily\\r\\nfrom their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey\\r\\nside. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the\\r\\nriver, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the\\r\\nright and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well\\r\\nknown to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted\\r\\nhim. One of them held the horse\\'s head while the other led us in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is on duty?\" asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Inspector Bradstreet, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?\" A tall, stout official had come\\r\\ndown the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged\\r\\njacket. \"I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\"\\r\\n\"Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\" It was a small,\\r\\noffice-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a\\r\\ntelephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his\\r\\ndesk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged\\r\\nwith being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.\\r\\nClair, of Lee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I heard. You have him here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the cells.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is he quiet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dirty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his\\r\\nface is as black as a tinker\\'s. Well, when once his case has been\\r\\nsettled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you\\r\\nsaw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like to see him very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave\\r\\nyour bag.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I think that I\\'ll take it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good. Come this way, if you please.\" He led us down a\\r\\npassage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and\\r\\nbrought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The third on the right is his,\" said the inspector. \"Here it\\r\\nis!\" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door\\r\\nand glanced through.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is asleep,\" said he. \"You can see him very well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his\\r\\nface towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and\\r\\nheavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his\\r\\ncalling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his\\r\\ntattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely\\r\\ndirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its\\r\\nrepulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right\\r\\nacross it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up\\r\\none side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a\\r\\nperpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over\\r\\nhis eyes and forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s a beauty, isn\\'t he?\" said the inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He certainly needs a wash,\" remarked Holmes. \"I had an idea that\\r\\nhe might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\"\\r\\nHe opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my\\r\\nastonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He! he! You are a funny one,\" chuckled the inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\\r\\nquietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable\\r\\nfigure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know why not,\" said the inspector. \"He doesn\\'t\\r\\nlook a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\" He slipped his\\r\\nkey into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The\\r\\nsleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep\\r\\nslumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,\\r\\nand then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the\\r\\nprisoner\\'s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me introduce you,\" he shouted, \"to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of\\r\\nLee, in the county of Kent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\\'s face peeled\\r\\noff under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the\\r\\ncoarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had\\r\\nseamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the\\r\\nrepulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled\\r\\nred hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,\\r\\nsad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,\\r\\nrubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.\\r\\nThen suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and\\r\\nthrew himself down with his face to the pillow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Great heavens!\" cried the inspector, \"it is, indeed, the missing\\r\\nman. I know him from the photograph.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons\\r\\nhimself to his destiny. \"Be it so,\" said he. \"And pray what am I\\r\\ncharged with?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can\\'t be\\r\\ncharged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of\\r\\nit,\" said the inspector with a grin. \"Well, I have been\\r\\ntwenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime\\r\\nhas been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally\\r\\ndetained.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No crime, but a very great error has been committed,\" said\\r\\nHolmes. \"You would have done better to have trusted your wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not the wife; it was the children,\" groaned the prisoner.\\r\\n\"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My\\r\\nGod! What an exposure! What can I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him\\r\\nkindly on the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\" said\\r\\nhe, \"of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,\\r\\nif you convince the police authorities that there is no possible\\r\\ncase against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the\\r\\ndetails should find their way into the papers. Inspector\\r\\nBradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you\\r\\nmight tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case\\r\\nwould then never go into court at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless you!\" cried the prisoner passionately. \"I would have\\r\\nendured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left\\r\\nmy miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\\r\\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent\\r\\neducation. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and\\r\\nfinally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day\\r\\nmy editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the\\r\\nmetropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point\\r\\nfrom which all my adventures started. It was only by trying\\r\\nbegging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to\\r\\nbase my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the\\r\\nsecrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for\\r\\nmy skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my\\r\\nface, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good\\r\\nscar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a\\r\\nsmall slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of\\r\\nhair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business\\r\\npart of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a\\r\\nbeggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned\\r\\nhome in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no\\r\\nless than 26s. 4d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,\\r\\nsome time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ\\r\\nserved upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit\\'s end where to get\\r\\nthe money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight\\'s\\r\\ngrace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,\\r\\nand spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In\\r\\nten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous\\r\\nwork at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in\\r\\na day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on\\r\\nthe ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my\\r\\npride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up\\r\\nreporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first\\r\\nchosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets\\r\\nwith coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a\\r\\nlow den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could\\r\\nevery morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings\\r\\ntransform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow,\\r\\na Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that\\r\\nmy secret was safe in his possession.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of\\r\\nmoney. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London\\r\\ncould earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average\\r\\ntakings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making\\r\\nup, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by\\r\\npractice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.\\r\\nAll day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,\\r\\nand it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the\\r\\ncountry, and eventually married, without anyone having a\\r\\nsuspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had\\r\\nbusiness in the City. She little knew what.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my\\r\\nroom above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,\\r\\nto my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the\\r\\nstreet, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of\\r\\nsurprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my\\r\\nconfidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from\\r\\ncoming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that\\r\\nshe could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on\\r\\nthose of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife\\'s\\r\\neyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it\\r\\noccurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that\\r\\nthe clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening\\r\\nby my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in\\r\\nthe bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was\\r\\nweighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from\\r\\nthe leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of\\r\\nthe window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes\\r\\nwould have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of\\r\\nconstables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,\\r\\nI confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.\\r\\nNeville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I\\r\\nwas determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and\\r\\nhence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would\\r\\nbe terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the\\r\\nLascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together\\r\\nwith a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to\\r\\nfear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That note only reached her yesterday,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God! What a week she must have spent!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The police have watched this Lascar,\" said Inspector Bradstreet,\\r\\n\"and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to\\r\\npost a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor\\r\\ncustomer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was it,\" said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \"I have no doubt\\r\\nof it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many times; but what was a fine to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must stop here, however,\" said Bradstreet. \"If the police are\\r\\nto hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps\\r\\nmay be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.\\r\\nI am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for\\r\\nhaving cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your\\r\\nresults.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I reached this one,\" said my friend, \"by sitting upon five\\r\\npillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if\\r\\nwe drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\\r\\n\\r\\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second\\r\\nmorning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the\\r\\ncompliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a\\r\\npurple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the\\r\\nright, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly\\r\\nstudied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and\\r\\non the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable\\r\\nhard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several\\r\\nplaces. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\\r\\nsuggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the\\r\\npurpose of examination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are engaged,\" said I; \"perhaps I interrupt you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss\\r\\nmy results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\"--he jerked his\\r\\nthumb in the direction of the old hat--\"but there are points in\\r\\nconnection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and\\r\\neven of instruction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his\\r\\ncrackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows\\r\\nwere thick with the ice crystals. \"I suppose,\" I remarked, \"that,\\r\\nhomely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to\\r\\nit--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of\\r\\nsome mystery and the punishment of some crime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no. No crime,\" said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \"Only one of\\r\\nthose whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have\\r\\nfour million human beings all jostling each other within the\\r\\nspace of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so\\r\\ndense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events\\r\\nmay be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be\\r\\npresented which may be striking and bizarre without being\\r\\ncriminal. We have already had experience of such.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much so,\" I remarked, \"that of the last six cases which I\\r\\nhave added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any\\r\\nlegal crime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler\\r\\npapers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the\\r\\nadventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt\\r\\nthat this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.\\r\\nYou know Peterson, the commissionaire?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is to him that this trophy belongs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is his hat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will\\r\\nlook upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual\\r\\nproblem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon\\r\\nChristmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I\\r\\nhave no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson\\'s\\r\\nfire. The facts are these: about four o\\'clock on Christmas\\r\\nmorning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was\\r\\nreturning from some small jollification and was making his way\\r\\nhomeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in\\r\\nthe gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and\\r\\ncarrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\\r\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger\\r\\nand a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the\\r\\nman\\'s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,\\r\\nswinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.\\r\\nPeterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his\\r\\nassailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and\\r\\nseeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,\\r\\ndropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the\\r\\nlabyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham\\r\\nCourt Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\\r\\nPeterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of\\r\\nbattle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this\\r\\nbattered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which surely he restored to their owner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \\'For\\r\\nMrs. Henry Baker\\' was printed upon a small card which was tied to\\r\\nthe bird\\'s left leg, and it is also true that the initials \\'H.\\r\\nB.\\' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are\\r\\nsome thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in\\r\\nthis city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any\\r\\none of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, then, did Peterson do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\\r\\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.\\r\\nThe goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs\\r\\nthat, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it\\r\\nshould be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried\\r\\nit off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,\\r\\nwhile I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who\\r\\nlost his Christmas dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he not advertise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only as much as we can deduce.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From his hat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered\\r\\nfelt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather\\r\\nyourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this\\r\\narticle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather\\r\\nruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round\\r\\nshape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of\\r\\nred silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker\\'s\\r\\nname; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \"H. B.\" were\\r\\nscrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a\\r\\nhat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was\\r\\ncracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,\\r\\nalthough there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the\\r\\ndiscoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can see nothing,\" said I, handing it back to my friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,\\r\\nhowever, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in\\r\\ndrawing your inferences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective\\r\\nfashion which was characteristic of him. \"It is perhaps less\\r\\nsuggestive than it might have been,\" he remarked, \"and yet there\\r\\nare a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others\\r\\nwhich represent at least a strong balance of probability. That\\r\\nthe man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the\\r\\nface of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the\\r\\nlast three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He\\r\\nhad foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a\\r\\nmoral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\\r\\nfortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,\\r\\nat work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that\\r\\nhis wife has ceased to love him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\" he\\r\\ncontinued, disregarding my remonstrance. \"He is a man who leads a\\r\\nsedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is\\r\\nmiddle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the\\r\\nlast few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are\\r\\nthe more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,\\r\\nby the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid\\r\\non in his house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are certainly joking, Holmes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you\\r\\nthese results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I\\r\\nam unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that\\r\\nthis man was intellectual?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right\\r\\nover the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \"It is\\r\\na question of cubic capacity,\" said he; \"a man with so large a\\r\\nbrain must have something in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The decline of his fortunes, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge\\r\\ncame in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the\\r\\nband of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could\\r\\nafford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no\\r\\nhat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the\\r\\nforesight and the moral retrogression?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \"Here is the foresight,\" said he putting\\r\\nhis finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.\\r\\n\"They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a\\r\\nsign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his\\r\\nway to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see\\r\\nthat he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace\\r\\nit, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,\\r\\nwhich is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other\\r\\nhand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the\\r\\nfelt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not\\r\\nentirely lost his self-respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your reasoning is certainly plausible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is\\r\\ngrizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses\\r\\nlime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the\\r\\nlower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of\\r\\nhair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all\\r\\nappear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of\\r\\nlime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey\\r\\ndust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,\\r\\nshowing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while\\r\\nthe marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the\\r\\nwearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in\\r\\nthe best of training.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear\\r\\nWatson, with a week\\'s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and\\r\\nwhen your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear\\r\\nthat you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\\'s\\r\\naffection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he might be a bachelor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his\\r\\nwife. Remember the card upon the bird\\'s leg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce\\r\\nthat the gas is not laid on in his house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I\\r\\nsee no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt\\r\\nthat the individual must be brought into frequent contact with\\r\\nburning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in\\r\\none hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never\\r\\ngot tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it is very ingenious,\" said I, laughing; \"but since, as\\r\\nyou said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm\\r\\ndone save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a\\r\\nwaste of energy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew\\r\\nopen, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment\\r\\nwith flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\" he gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off\\r\\nthrough the kitchen window?\" Holmes twisted himself round upon\\r\\nthe sofa to get a fairer view of the man\\'s excited face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\" He held out\\r\\nhis hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly\\r\\nscintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but\\r\\nof such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric\\r\\npoint in the dark hollow of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \"By Jove, Peterson!\" said\\r\\nhe, \"this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you\\r\\nhave got?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though\\r\\nit were putty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the Countess of Morcar\\'s blue carbuncle!\" I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I\\r\\nhave read the advertisement about it in The Times every day\\r\\nlately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be\\r\\nconjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly\\r\\nnot within a twentieth part of the market price.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\" The commissionaire\\r\\nplumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are\\r\\nsentimental considerations in the background which would induce\\r\\nthe Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but\\r\\nrecover the gem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\" I\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,\\r\\na plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\\'s\\r\\njewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case\\r\\nhas been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the\\r\\nmatter here, I believe.\" He rummaged amid his newspapers,\\r\\nglancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,\\r\\ndoubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was\\r\\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,\\r\\nabstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the\\r\\nvaluable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,\\r\\nupper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect\\r\\nthat he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess\\r\\nof Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might\\r\\nsolder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had\\r\\nremained with Horner some little time, but had finally been\\r\\ncalled away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,\\r\\nthat the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco\\r\\ncasket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was\\r\\naccustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the\\r\\ndressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was\\r\\narrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found\\r\\neither upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to\\r\\nthe Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\\'s cry of dismay on\\r\\ndiscovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,\\r\\nwhere she found matters as described by the last witness.\\r\\nInspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest\\r\\nof Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence\\r\\nin the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for\\r\\nrobbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate\\r\\nrefused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to\\r\\nthe Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion\\r\\nduring the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was\\r\\ncarried out of court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum! So much for the police-court,\" said Holmes thoughtfully,\\r\\ntossing aside the paper. \"The question for us now to solve is the\\r\\nsequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to\\r\\nthe crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You\\r\\nsee, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much\\r\\nmore important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the\\r\\nstone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry\\r\\nBaker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other\\r\\ncharacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set\\r\\nourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and\\r\\nascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To\\r\\ndo this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie\\r\\nundoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If\\r\\nthis fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What will you say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \\'Found at\\r\\nthe corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.\\r\\nHenry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at\\r\\n221B, Baker Street.\\' That is clear and concise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very. But will he see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor\\r\\nman, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his\\r\\nmischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson\\r\\nthat he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must\\r\\nhave bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his\\r\\nbird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to\\r\\nsee it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to\\r\\nit. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency\\r\\nand have this put in the evening papers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In which, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James\\'s, Evening News,\\r\\nStandard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, sir. And this stone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,\\r\\nPeterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here\\r\\nwith me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place\\r\\nof the one which your family is now devouring.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and\\r\\nheld it against the light. \"It\\'s a bonny thing,\" said he. \"Just\\r\\nsee how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and\\r\\nfocus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil\\'s pet\\r\\nbaits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a\\r\\nbloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found\\r\\nin the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable\\r\\nin having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is\\r\\nblue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has\\r\\nalready a sinister history. There have been two murders, a\\r\\nvitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about\\r\\nfor the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.\\r\\nWho would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the\\r\\ngallows and the prison? I\\'ll lock it up in my strong box now and\\r\\ndrop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot tell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\\r\\nanything to do with the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an\\r\\nabsolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he\\r\\nwas carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made\\r\\nof solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple\\r\\ntest if we have an answer to our advertisement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you can do nothing until then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall\\r\\ncome back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I\\r\\nshould like to see the solution of so tangled a business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I\\r\\nbelieve. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I\\r\\nought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past\\r\\nsix when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I\\r\\napproached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a\\r\\ncoat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the\\r\\nbright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I\\r\\narrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to\\r\\nHolmes\\' room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,\" said he, rising from his armchair\\r\\nand greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he\\r\\ncould so readily assume. \"Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.\\r\\nBaker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is\\r\\nmore adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have\\r\\njust come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a\\r\\nbroad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of\\r\\ngrizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight\\r\\ntremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes\\' surmise as to his\\r\\nhabits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in\\r\\nfront, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded\\r\\nfrom his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a\\r\\nslow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the\\r\\nimpression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had\\r\\nill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have retained these things for some days,\" said Holmes,\\r\\n\"because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your\\r\\naddress. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \"Shillings have not\\r\\nbeen so plentiful with me as they once were,\" he remarked. \"I had\\r\\nno doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off\\r\\nboth my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a\\r\\nhopeless attempt at recovering them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to\\r\\neat it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To eat it!\" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his\\r\\nexcitement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.\\r\\nBut I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is\\r\\nabout the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your\\r\\npurpose equally well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, certainly, certainly,\" answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of\\r\\nrelief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of\\r\\nyour own bird, so if you wish--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. \"They might be useful to me as\\r\\nrelics of my adventure,\" said he, \"but beyond that I can hardly\\r\\nsee what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are\\r\\ngoing to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I\\r\\nwill confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive\\r\\nupon the sideboard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug\\r\\nof his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is your hat, then, and there your bird,\" said he. \"By the\\r\\nway, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one\\r\\nfrom? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a\\r\\nbetter grown goose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly\\r\\ngained property under his arm. \"There are a few of us who\\r\\nfrequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in\\r\\nthe Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our\\r\\ngood host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,\\r\\non consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to\\r\\nreceive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the\\r\\nrest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a\\r\\nScotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\" With\\r\\na comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and\\r\\nstrode off upon his way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much for Mr. Henry Baker,\" said Holmes when he had closed the\\r\\ndoor behind him. \"It is quite certain that he knows nothing\\r\\nwhatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not particularly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow\\r\\nup this clue while it is still hot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped\\r\\ncravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly\\r\\nin a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out\\r\\ninto smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out\\r\\ncrisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors\\' quarter,\\r\\nWimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into\\r\\nOxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at\\r\\nthe Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one\\r\\nof the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open\\r\\nthe door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from\\r\\nthe ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\"\\r\\nsaid he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My geese!\" The man seemed surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,\\r\\nwho was a member of your goose club.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\\'s not our geese.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! Whose, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Breckinridge is his name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! I don\\'t know him. Well, here\\'s your good health landlord,\\r\\nand prosperity to your house. Good-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now for Mr. Breckinridge,\" he continued, buttoning up his coat\\r\\nas we came out into the frosty air. \"Remember, Watson that though\\r\\nwe have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we\\r\\nhave at the other a man who will certainly get seven years\\' penal\\r\\nservitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible\\r\\nthat our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we\\r\\nhave a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,\\r\\nand which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us\\r\\nfollow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and\\r\\nquick march!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a\\r\\nzigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest\\r\\nstalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor\\r\\na horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was\\r\\nhelping a boy to put up the shutters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-evening. It\\'s a cold night,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sold out of geese, I see,\" continued Holmes, pointing at the\\r\\nbare slabs of marble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s no good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, but I was recommended to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who by?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The landlord of the Alpha.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the\\r\\nsalesman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, then, mister,\" said he, with his head cocked and his arms\\r\\nakimbo, \"what are you driving at? Let\\'s have it straight, now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the\\r\\ngeese which you supplied to the Alpha.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well then, I shan\\'t tell you. So now!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\\'t know why you\\r\\nshould be so warm over such a trifle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Warm! You\\'d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.\\r\\nWhen I pay good money for a good article there should be an end\\r\\nof the business; but it\\'s \\'Where are the geese?\\' and \\'Who did you\\r\\nsell the geese to?\\' and \\'What will you take for the geese?\\' One\\r\\nwould think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the\\r\\nfuss that is made over them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been\\r\\nmaking inquiries,\" said Holmes carelessly. \"If you won\\'t tell us\\r\\nthe bet is off, that is all. But I\\'m always ready to back my\\r\\nopinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the\\r\\nbird I ate is country bred.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, you\\'ve lost your fiver, for it\\'s town bred,\" snapped\\r\\nthe salesman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s nothing of the kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"D\\'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled\\r\\nthem ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that\\r\\nwent to the Alpha were town bred.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll never persuade me to believe that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you bet, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But\\r\\nI\\'ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be\\r\\nobstinate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. \"Bring me the books, Bill,\" said\\r\\nhe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great\\r\\ngreasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging\\r\\nlamp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now then, Mr. Cocksure,\" said the salesman, \"I thought that I\\r\\nwas out of geese, but before I finish you\\'ll find that there is\\r\\nstill one left in my shop. You see this little book?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\\'you see? Well,\\r\\nthen, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers\\r\\nafter their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.\\r\\nNow, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a\\r\\nlist of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just\\r\\nread it out to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249,\" read Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. \"Here you are, \\'Mrs.\\r\\nOakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, then, what\\'s the last entry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have you to say now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from\\r\\nhis pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the\\r\\nair of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off\\r\\nhe stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless\\r\\nfashion which was peculiar to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \\'Pink \\'un\\'\\r\\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\"\\r\\nsaid he. \"I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of\\r\\nhim, that man would not have given me such complete information\\r\\nas was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a\\r\\nwager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our\\r\\nquest, and the only point which remains to be determined is\\r\\nwhether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or\\r\\nwhether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what\\r\\nthat surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves\\r\\nwho are anxious about the matter, and I should--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke\\r\\nout from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a\\r\\nlittle rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of\\r\\nyellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while\\r\\nBreckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was\\r\\nshaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve had enough of you and your geese,\" he shouted. \"I wish you\\r\\nwere all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more\\r\\nwith your silly talk I\\'ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.\\r\\nOakshott here and I\\'ll answer her, but what have you to do with\\r\\nit? Did I buy the geese off you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but one of them was mine all the same,\" whined the little\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She told me to ask you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\\'ve had\\r\\nenough of it. Get out of this!\" He rushed fiercely forward, and\\r\\nthe inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\" whispered Holmes.\\r\\n\"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this\\r\\nfellow.\" Striding through the scattered knots of people who\\r\\nlounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook\\r\\nthe little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang\\r\\nround, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of\\r\\ncolour had been driven from his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who are you, then? What do you want?\" he asked in a quavering\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will excuse me,\" said Holmes blandly, \"but I could not help\\r\\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.\\r\\nI think that I could be of assistance to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other\\r\\npeople don\\'t know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you can know nothing of this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to\\r\\ntrace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton\\r\\nRoad, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.\\r\\nWindigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.\\r\\nHenry Baker is a member.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\" cried\\r\\nthe little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.\\r\\n\"I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \"In that\\r\\ncase we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this\\r\\nwind-swept market-place,\" said he. \"But pray tell me, before we\\r\\ngo farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. \"My name is John Robinson,\" he\\r\\nanswered with a sidelong glance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; the real name,\" said Holmes sweetly. \"It is always\\r\\nawkward doing business with an alias.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \"Well then,\"\\r\\nsaid he, \"my real name is James Ryder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray\\r\\nstep into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you\\r\\neverything which you would wish to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with\\r\\nhalf-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure\\r\\nwhether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.\\r\\nThen he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in\\r\\nthe sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during\\r\\nour drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and\\r\\nthe claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous\\r\\ntension within him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here we are!\" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.\\r\\n\"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,\\r\\nMr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my\\r\\nslippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!\\r\\nYou want to know what became of those geese?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in\\r\\nwhich you were interested--white, with a black bar across the\\r\\ntail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRyder quivered with emotion. \"Oh, sir,\" he cried, \"can you tell\\r\\nme where it went to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It came here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\\'t wonder that\\r\\nyou should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was\\r\\ndead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.\\r\\nI have it here in my museum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece\\r\\nwith his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up\\r\\nthe blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,\\r\\nbrilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a\\r\\ndrawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The game\\'s up, Ryder,\" said Holmes quietly. \"Hold up, man, or\\r\\nyou\\'ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,\\r\\nWatson. He\\'s not got blood enough to go in for felony with\\r\\nimpunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little\\r\\nmore human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy\\r\\nbrought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring\\r\\nwith frightened eyes at his accuser.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I\\r\\ncould possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.\\r\\nStill, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case\\r\\ncomplete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the\\r\\nCountess of Morcar\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\" said he in a\\r\\ncrackling voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see--her ladyship\\'s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of\\r\\nsudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has\\r\\nbeen for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous\\r\\nin the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the\\r\\nmaking of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man\\r\\nHorner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter\\r\\nbefore, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.\\r\\nWhat did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady\\'s\\r\\nroom--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he\\r\\nshould be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled\\r\\nthe jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man\\r\\narrested. You then--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\\r\\ncompanion\\'s knees. \"For God\\'s sake, have mercy!\" he shrieked.\\r\\n\"Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I\\r\\nnever went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\\'ll\\r\\nswear it on a Bible. Oh, don\\'t bring it into court! For Christ\\'s\\r\\nsake, don\\'t!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get back into your chair!\" said Holmes sternly. \"It is very well\\r\\nto cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this\\r\\npoor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the\\r\\ncharge against him will break down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account\\r\\nof the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came\\r\\nthe goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies\\r\\nyour only hope of safety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \"I will tell you\\r\\nit just as it happened, sir,\" said he. \"When Horner had been\\r\\narrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get\\r\\naway with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment\\r\\nthe police might not take it into their heads to search me and my\\r\\nroom. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.\\r\\nI went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister\\'s\\r\\nhouse. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton\\r\\nRoad, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there\\r\\nevery man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;\\r\\nand, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down\\r\\nmy face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me\\r\\nwhat was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I\\r\\nhad been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went\\r\\ninto the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would\\r\\nbe best to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and\\r\\nhas just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met\\r\\nme, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they\\r\\ncould get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to\\r\\nme, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind\\r\\nto go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my\\r\\nconfidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.\\r\\nBut how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had\\r\\ngone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be\\r\\nseized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat\\r\\npocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at\\r\\nthe geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly\\r\\nan idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the\\r\\nbest detective that ever lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the\\r\\npick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she\\r\\nwas always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in\\r\\nit I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in\\r\\nthe yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big\\r\\none, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill\\r\\nopen, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger\\r\\ncould reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass\\r\\nalong its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped\\r\\nand struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the\\r\\nmatter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and\\r\\nfluttered off among the others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\\' says she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well,\\' said I, \\'you said you\\'d give me one for Christmas, and I\\r\\nwas feeling which was the fattest.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh,\\' says she, \\'we\\'ve set yours aside for you--Jem\\'s bird, we\\r\\ncall it. It\\'s the big white one over yonder. There\\'s twenty-six\\r\\nof them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen\\r\\nfor the market.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Thank you, Maggie,\\' says I; \\'but if it is all the same to you,\\r\\nI\\'d rather have that one I was handling just now.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'The other is a good three pound heavier,\\' said she, \\'and we\\r\\nfattened it expressly for you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Never mind. I\\'ll have the other, and I\\'ll take it now,\\' said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, just as you like,\\' said she, a little huffed. \\'Which is it\\r\\nyou want, then?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the\\r\\nflock.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird\\r\\nall the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was\\r\\na man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed\\r\\nuntil he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My\\r\\nheart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I\\r\\nknew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,\\r\\nrushed back to my sister\\'s, and hurried into the back yard. There\\r\\nwas not a bird to be seen there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Where are they all, Maggie?\\' I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Gone to the dealer\\'s, Jem.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Which dealer\\'s?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'But was there another with a barred tail?\\' I asked, \\'the same\\r\\nas the one I chose?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never\\r\\ntell them apart.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my\\r\\nfeet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the\\r\\nlot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they\\r\\nhad gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always\\r\\nanswered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.\\r\\nSometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself\\r\\na branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which\\r\\nI sold my character. God help me! God help me!\" He burst into\\r\\nconvulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and\\r\\nby the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\\' finger-tips upon the\\r\\nedge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get out!\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No more words. Get out!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon\\r\\nthe stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running\\r\\nfootfalls from the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all, Watson,\" said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his\\r\\nclay pipe, \"I am not retained by the police to supply their\\r\\ndeficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;\\r\\nbut this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must\\r\\ncollapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just\\r\\npossible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong\\r\\nagain; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and\\r\\nyou make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of\\r\\nforgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and\\r\\nwhimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you\\r\\nwill have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin\\r\\nanother investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief\\r\\nfeature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\\r\\n\\r\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I\\r\\nhave during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend\\r\\nSherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number\\r\\nmerely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did\\r\\nrather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of\\r\\nwealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation\\r\\nwhich did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.\\r\\nOf all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which\\r\\npresented more singular features than that which was associated\\r\\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.\\r\\nThe events in question occurred in the early days of my\\r\\nassociation with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors\\r\\nin Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them\\r\\nupon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the\\r\\ntime, from which I have only been freed during the last month by\\r\\nthe untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It\\r\\nis perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I\\r\\nhave reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the\\r\\ndeath of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even\\r\\nmore terrible than the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was early in April in the year \\'83 that I woke one morning to\\r\\nfind Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my\\r\\nbed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the\\r\\nmantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I\\r\\nblinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little\\r\\nresentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\" said he, \"but it\\'s the\\r\\ncommon lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she\\r\\nretorted upon me, and I on you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it, then--a fire?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a\\r\\nconsiderable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She\\r\\nis waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander\\r\\nabout the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock\\r\\nsleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is\\r\\nsomething very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it\\r\\nprove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to\\r\\nfollow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should\\r\\ncall you and give you the chance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his\\r\\nprofessional investigations, and in admiring the rapid\\r\\ndeductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a\\r\\nlogical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were\\r\\nsubmitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in\\r\\na few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A\\r\\nlady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in\\r\\nthe window, rose as we entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-morning, madam,\" said Holmes cheerily. \"My name is Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,\\r\\nbefore whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am\\r\\nglad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the\\r\\nfire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot\\r\\ncoffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not cold which makes me shiver,\" said the woman in a low\\r\\nvoice, changing her seat as requested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\" She raised her veil as\\r\\nshe spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable\\r\\nstate of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless\\r\\nfrightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features\\r\\nand figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot\\r\\nwith premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,\\r\\nall-comprehensive glances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not fear,\" said he soothingly, bending forward and\\r\\npatting her forearm. \"We shall soon set matters right, I have no\\r\\ndoubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know me, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm\\r\\nof your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had\\r\\na good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached\\r\\nthe station.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no mystery, my dear madam,\" said he, smiling. \"The left\\r\\narm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven\\r\\nplaces. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a\\r\\ndog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you\\r\\nsit on the left-hand side of the driver.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\" said\\r\\nshe. \"I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at\\r\\ntwenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I\\r\\ncan stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.\\r\\nI have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,\\r\\nand he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,\\r\\nMr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you\\r\\nhelped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had\\r\\nyour address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,\\r\\ntoo, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness\\r\\nwhich surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\\r\\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be\\r\\nmarried, with the control of my own income, and then at least you\\r\\nshall not find me ungrateful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small\\r\\ncase-book, which he consulted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Farintosh,\" said he. \"Ah yes, I recall the case; it was\\r\\nconcerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,\\r\\nWatson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote\\r\\nthe same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to\\r\\nreward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty\\r\\nto defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which\\r\\nsuits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us\\r\\neverything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\\r\\nmatter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alas!\" replied our visitor, \"the very horror of my situation\\r\\nlies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions\\r\\ndepend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to\\r\\nanother, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to\\r\\nlook for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it\\r\\nas the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can\\r\\nread it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have\\r\\nheard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold\\r\\nwickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid\\r\\nthe dangers which encompass me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am all attention, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who\\r\\nis the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in\\r\\nEngland, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of\\r\\nSurrey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes nodded his head. \"The name is familiar to me,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\\r\\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,\\r\\nand Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four\\r\\nsuccessive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,\\r\\nand the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the\\r\\ndays of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,\\r\\nand the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under\\r\\na heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence\\r\\nthere, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but\\r\\nhis only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to\\r\\nthe new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which\\r\\nenabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,\\r\\nwhere, by his professional skill and his force of character, he\\r\\nestablished a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused\\r\\nby some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he\\r\\nbeat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital\\r\\nsentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and\\r\\nafterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner,\\r\\nthe young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.\\r\\nMy sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old\\r\\nat the time of my mother\\'s re-marriage. She had a considerable\\r\\nsum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she\\r\\nbequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,\\r\\nwith a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to\\r\\neach of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return\\r\\nto England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a\\r\\nrailway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his\\r\\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us\\r\\nto live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The\\r\\nmoney which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and\\r\\nthere seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.\\r\\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our\\r\\nneighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of\\r\\nStoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in\\r\\nhis house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious\\r\\nquarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper\\r\\napproaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the\\r\\nfamily, and in my stepfather\\'s case it had, I believe, been\\r\\nintensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of\\r\\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the\\r\\npolice-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,\\r\\nand the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of\\r\\nimmense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a\\r\\nstream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I\\r\\ncould gather together that I was able to avert another public\\r\\nexposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,\\r\\nand he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few\\r\\nacres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,\\r\\nand would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,\\r\\nwandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a\\r\\npassion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a\\r\\ncorrespondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,\\r\\nwhich wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the\\r\\nvillagers almost as much as their master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I\\r\\nhad no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with\\r\\nus, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was\\r\\nbut thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already\\r\\nbegun to whiten, even as mine has.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your sister is dead, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish\\r\\nto speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I\\r\\nhave described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own\\r\\nage and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\\'s maiden\\r\\nsister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we\\r\\nwere occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady\\'s\\r\\nhouse. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there\\r\\na half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My\\r\\nstepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and\\r\\noffered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of\\r\\nthe day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event\\r\\noccurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes\\r\\nclosed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his\\r\\nlids now and glanced across at his visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray be precise as to details,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful\\r\\ntime is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have\\r\\nalready said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The\\r\\nbedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms\\r\\nbeing in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms\\r\\nthe first is Dr. Roylott\\'s, the second my sister\\'s, and the third\\r\\nmy own. There is no communication between them, but they all open\\r\\nout into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That\\r\\nfatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we\\r\\nknew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled\\r\\nby the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom\\r\\nto smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where\\r\\nshe sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At\\r\\neleven o\\'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door\\r\\nand looked back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tell me, Helen,\\' said she, \\'have you ever heard anyone whistle\\r\\nin the dead of the night?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Never,\\' said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in\\r\\nyour sleep?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Certainly not. But why?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three\\r\\nin the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,\\r\\nand it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps\\r\\nfrom the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would\\r\\njust ask you whether you had heard it.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the\\r\\nplantation.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you\\r\\ndid not hear it also.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\\' She smiled\\r\\nback at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her\\r\\nkey turn in the lock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" said Holmes. \"Was it your custom always to lock\\r\\nyourselves in at night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah\\r\\nand a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were\\r\\nlocked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending\\r\\nmisfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,\\r\\nwere twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two\\r\\nsouls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind\\r\\nwas howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing\\r\\nagainst the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,\\r\\nthere burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew\\r\\nthat it was my sister\\'s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a\\r\\nshawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door\\r\\nI seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and\\r\\na few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had\\r\\nfallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister\\'s door was unlocked,\\r\\nand revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it\\r\\nhorror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By\\r\\nthe light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the\\r\\nopening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for\\r\\nhelp, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a\\r\\ndrunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\\r\\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.\\r\\nShe writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were\\r\\ndreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not\\r\\nrecognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out\\r\\nin a voice which I shall never forget, \\'Oh, my God! Helen! It was\\r\\nthe band! The speckled band!\\' There was something else which she\\r\\nwould fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the\\r\\nair in the direction of the doctor\\'s room, but a fresh convulsion\\r\\nseized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for\\r\\nmy stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\\r\\ndressing-gown. When he reached my sister\\'s side she was\\r\\nunconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent\\r\\nfor medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for\\r\\nshe slowly sank and died without having recovered her\\r\\nconsciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One moment,\" said Holmes, \"are you sure about this whistle and\\r\\nmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is\\r\\nmy strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of\\r\\nthe gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have\\r\\nbeen deceived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was your sister dressed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\\r\\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when\\r\\nthe alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did\\r\\nthe coroner come to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\\'s\\r\\nconduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable\\r\\nto find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that\\r\\nthe door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows\\r\\nwere blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,\\r\\nwhich were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,\\r\\nand were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was\\r\\nalso thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is\\r\\nwide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,\\r\\ntherefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.\\r\\nBesides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How about poison?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The doctors examined her for it, but without success.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,\\r\\nthough what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there are nearly always some there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a\\r\\nspeckled band?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of\\r\\ndelirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of\\r\\npeople, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not\\r\\nknow whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear\\r\\nover their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which\\r\\nshe used.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are very deep waters,\" said he; \"pray go on with your\\r\\nnarrative.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until\\r\\nlately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,\\r\\nwhom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask\\r\\nmy hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the\\r\\nsecond son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My\\r\\nstepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to\\r\\nbe married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs\\r\\nwere started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom\\r\\nwall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the\\r\\nchamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in\\r\\nwhich she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\\r\\nnight, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I\\r\\nsuddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which\\r\\nhad been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the\\r\\nlamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to\\r\\ngo to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was\\r\\ndaylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which\\r\\nis opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on\\r\\nthis morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your\\r\\nadvice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have done wisely,\" said my friend. \"But have you told me\\r\\nall?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, what do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which\\r\\nfringed the hand that lay upon our visitor\\'s knee. Five little\\r\\nlivid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed\\r\\nupon the white wrist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been cruelly used,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \"He\\r\\nis a hard man,\" she said, \"and perhaps he hardly knows his own\\r\\nstrength.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin\\r\\nupon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a very deep business,\" he said at last. \"There are a\\r\\nthousand details which I should desire to know before I decide\\r\\nupon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If\\r\\nwe were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for\\r\\nus to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your\\r\\nstepfather?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some\\r\\nmost important business. It is probable that he will be away all\\r\\nday, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a\\r\\nhousekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily\\r\\nget her out of the way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By no means.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am\\r\\nin town. But I shall return by the twelve o\\'clock train, so as to\\r\\nbe there in time for your coming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some\\r\\nsmall business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and\\r\\nbreakfast?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have\\r\\nconfided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you\\r\\nagain this afternoon.\" She dropped her thick black veil over her\\r\\nface and glided from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what do you think of it all, Watson?\" asked Sherlock Holmes,\\r\\nleaning back in his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dark enough and sinister enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls\\r\\nare sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,\\r\\nthen her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her\\r\\nmysterious end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the\\r\\nvery peculiar words of the dying woman?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of\\r\\na band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor,\\r\\nthe fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has\\r\\nan interest in preventing his stepdaughter\\'s marriage, the dying\\r\\nallusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner\\r\\nheard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of\\r\\nthose metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its\\r\\nplace, I think that there is good ground to think that the\\r\\nmystery may be cleared along those lines.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what, then, did the gipsies do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see many objections to any such theory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going\\r\\nto Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are\\r\\nfatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of\\r\\nthe devil!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that\\r\\nour door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had\\r\\nframed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar\\r\\nmixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a\\r\\nblack top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,\\r\\nwith a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his\\r\\nhat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his\\r\\nbreadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,\\r\\nseared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and\\r\\nmarked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other\\r\\nof us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\\r\\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old\\r\\nbird of prey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which of you is Holmes?\" asked this apparition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\" said my\\r\\ncompanion quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Doctor,\" said Holmes blandly. \"Pray take a seat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I\\r\\nhave traced her. What has she been saying to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a little cold for the time of the year,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What has she been saying to you?\" screamed the old man\\r\\nfuriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\" continued my\\r\\ncompanion imperturbably.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! You put me off, do you?\" said our new visitor, taking a step\\r\\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. \"I know you, you scoundrel!\\r\\nI have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holmes, the busybody!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis smile broadened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \"Your conversation is most\\r\\nentertaining,\" said he. \"When you go out close the door, for\\r\\nthere is a decided draught.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go when I have said my say. Don\\'t you dare to meddle with\\r\\nmy affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!\\r\\nI am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\" He stepped\\r\\nswiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with\\r\\nhis huge brown hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See that you keep yourself out of my grip,\" he snarled, and\\r\\nhurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He seems a very amiable person,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"I am\\r\\nnot quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him\\r\\nthat my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\" As he spoke\\r\\nhe picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,\\r\\nstraightened it out again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\\r\\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\\r\\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer\\r\\nfrom her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,\\r\\nWatson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk\\r\\ndown to Doctors\\' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may\\r\\nhelp us in this matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly one o\\'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\\r\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled\\r\\nover with notes and figures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen the will of the deceased wife,\" said he. \"To\\r\\ndetermine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the\\r\\npresent prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The\\r\\ntotal income, which at the time of the wife\\'s death was little\\r\\nshort of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural\\r\\nprices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an\\r\\nincome of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,\\r\\ntherefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have\\r\\nhad a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to\\r\\na very serious extent. My morning\\'s work has not been wasted,\\r\\nsince it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for\\r\\nstanding in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,\\r\\nthis is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is\\r\\naware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you\\r\\nare ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be\\r\\nvery much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your\\r\\npocket. An Eley\\'s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen\\r\\nwho can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush\\r\\nare, I think, all that we need.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for\\r\\nLeatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove\\r\\nfor four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a\\r\\nperfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the\\r\\nheavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out\\r\\ntheir first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant\\r\\nsmell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange\\r\\ncontrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this\\r\\nsinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in\\r\\nthe front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over\\r\\nhis eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the\\r\\ndeepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the\\r\\nshoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look there!\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,\\r\\nthickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the\\r\\nbranches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a\\r\\nvery old mansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stoke Moran?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\" remarked\\r\\nthe driver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is some building going on there,\" said Holmes; \"that is\\r\\nwhere we are going.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s the village,\" said the driver, pointing to a cluster of\\r\\nroofs some distance to the left; \"but if you want to get to the\\r\\nhouse, you\\'ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by\\r\\nthe foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is\\r\\nwalking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\" observed Holmes, shading\\r\\nhis eyes. \"Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way\\r\\nto Leatherhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought it as well,\" said Holmes as we climbed the stile,\\r\\n\"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or\\r\\non some definite business. It may stop his gossip.\\r\\nGood-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as\\r\\nour word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a\\r\\nface which spoke her joy. \"I have been waiting so eagerly for\\r\\nyou,\" she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. \"All has turned\\r\\nout splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely\\r\\nthat he will be back before evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor\\'s acquaintance,\"\\r\\nsaid Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had\\r\\noccurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" she cried, \"he has followed me, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So it appears.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What\\r\\nwill he say when he returns?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone\\r\\nmore cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself\\r\\nup from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to\\r\\nyour aunt\\'s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our\\r\\ntime, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to\\r\\nexamine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high\\r\\ncentral portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,\\r\\nthrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were\\r\\nbroken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly\\r\\ncaved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little\\r\\nbetter repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,\\r\\nand the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up\\r\\nfrom the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.\\r\\nSome scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the\\r\\nstone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any\\r\\nworkmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and\\r\\ndown the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the\\r\\noutsides of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,\\r\\nthe centre one to your sister\\'s, and the one next to the main\\r\\nbuilding to Dr. Roylott\\'s chamber?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does\\r\\nnot seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end\\r\\nwall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from\\r\\nmy room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow\\r\\nwing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There\\r\\nare windows in it, of course?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass\\r\\nthrough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were\\r\\nunapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness\\r\\nto go into your room and bar your shutters?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination\\r\\nthrough the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the\\r\\nshutter open, but without success. There was no slit through\\r\\nwhich a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his\\r\\nlens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built\\r\\nfirmly into the massive masonry. \"Hum!\" said he, scratching his\\r\\nchin in some perplexity, \"my theory certainly presents some\\r\\ndifficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were\\r\\nbolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon\\r\\nthe matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which\\r\\nthe three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third\\r\\nchamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss\\r\\nStoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her\\r\\nfate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a\\r\\ngaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A\\r\\nbrown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow\\r\\nwhite-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the\\r\\nleft-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small\\r\\nwicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save\\r\\nfor a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and\\r\\nthe panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\\r\\nand discoloured that it may have dated from the original building\\r\\nof the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat\\r\\nsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,\\r\\ntaking in every detail of the apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where does that bell communicate with?\" he asked at last\\r\\npointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the\\r\\ntassel actually lying upon the pillow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It goes to the housekeeper\\'s room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It looks newer than the other things?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\\r\\nwanted for ourselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.\\r\\nYou will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to\\r\\nthis floor.\" He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in\\r\\nhis hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining\\r\\nminutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with\\r\\nthe wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he\\r\\nwalked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and\\r\\nin running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the\\r\\nbell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, it\\'s a dummy,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t it ring?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.\\r\\nYou can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where\\r\\nthe little opening for the ventilator is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very absurd! I never noticed that before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very strange!\" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \"There are\\r\\none or two very singular points about this room. For example,\\r\\nwhat a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another\\r\\nroom, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated\\r\\nwith the outside air!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is also quite modern,\" said the lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?\" remarked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy\\r\\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\\r\\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into\\r\\nthe inner apartment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\\'s chamber was larger than that of his\\r\\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small\\r\\nwooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an\\r\\narmchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a\\r\\nround table, and a large iron safe were the principal things\\r\\nwhich met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each\\r\\nand all of them with the keenest interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s in here?\" he asked, tapping the safe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My stepfather\\'s business papers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you have seen inside, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of\\r\\npapers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There isn\\'t a cat in it, for example?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. What a strange idea!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, look at this!\" He took up a small saucer of milk which\\r\\nstood on the top of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; we don\\'t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\\r\\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I\\r\\ndaresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\" He\\r\\nsquatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat\\r\\nof it with the greatest attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. That is quite settled,\" said he, rising and putting\\r\\nhis lens in his pocket. \"Hullo! Here is something interesting!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on\\r\\none corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself\\r\\nand tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you make of that, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a common enough lash. But I don\\'t know why it should be\\r\\ntied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\\'s a wicked world,\\r\\nand when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst\\r\\nof all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and\\r\\nwith your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had never seen my friend\\'s face so grim or his brow so dark as\\r\\nit was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We\\r\\nhad walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss\\r\\nStoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he\\r\\nroused himself from his reverie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very essential, Miss Stoner,\" said he, \"that you should\\r\\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall most certainly do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may\\r\\ndepend upon your compliance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you that I am in your hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in\\r\\nyour room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the\\r\\nvillage inn over there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that is the Crown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a\\r\\nheadache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him\\r\\nretire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,\\r\\nundo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then\\r\\nwithdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want\\r\\ninto the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in\\r\\nspite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, easily.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The rest you will leave in our hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what will you do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate\\r\\nthe cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\"\\r\\nsaid Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\\'s sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, for pity\\'s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\\'s\\r\\ndeath.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and\\r\\nif she died from some sudden fright.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\\r\\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if\\r\\nDr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.\\r\\nGood-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,\\r\\nyou may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers\\r\\nthat threaten you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\\r\\nsitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and\\r\\nfrom our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and\\r\\nof the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw\\r\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside\\r\\nthe little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some\\r\\nslight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard\\r\\nthe hoarse roar of the doctor\\'s voice and saw the fury with which\\r\\nhe shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few\\r\\nminutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as\\r\\nthe lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, Watson,\" said Holmes as we sat together in the\\r\\ngathering darkness, \"I have really some scruples as to taking you\\r\\nto-night. There is a distinct element of danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I be of assistance?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your presence might be invaluable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I shall certainly come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very kind of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms\\r\\nthan was visible to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine\\r\\nthat you saw all that I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose\\r\\nthat could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw the ventilator, too?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to\\r\\nhave a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a\\r\\nrat could hardly pass through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to\\r\\nStoke Moran.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her\\r\\nsister could smell Dr. Roylott\\'s cigar. Now, of course that\\r\\nsuggested at once that there must be a communication between the\\r\\ntwo rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been\\r\\nremarked upon at the coroner\\'s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what harm can there be in that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A\\r\\nventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the\\r\\nbed dies. Does not that strike you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot as yet see any connection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened\\r\\nlike that before?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot say that I have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same\\r\\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may\\r\\ncall it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holmes,\" I cried, \"I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.\\r\\nWe are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible\\r\\ncrime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong\\r\\nhe is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.\\r\\nPalmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.\\r\\nThis man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall\\r\\nbe able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough\\r\\nbefore the night is over; for goodness\\' sake let us have a quiet\\r\\npipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more\\r\\ncheerful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout nine o\\'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,\\r\\nand all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours\\r\\npassed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of\\r\\neleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is our signal,\" said Holmes, springing to his feet; \"it\\r\\ncomes from the middle window.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,\\r\\nexplaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,\\r\\nand that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A\\r\\nmoment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing\\r\\nin our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us\\r\\nthrough the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for\\r\\nunrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way\\r\\namong the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about\\r\\nto enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel\\r\\nbushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted\\r\\nchild, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and\\r\\nthen ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My God!\" I whispered; \"did you see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like\\r\\na vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low\\r\\nlaugh and put his lips to my ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a nice household,\" he murmured. \"That is the baboon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There\\r\\nwas a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders\\r\\nat any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,\\r\\nafter following Holmes\\' example and slipping off my shoes, I\\r\\nfound myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed\\r\\nthe shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes\\r\\nround the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then\\r\\ncreeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered\\r\\ninto my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to\\r\\ndistinguish the words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The least sound would be fatal to our plans.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must sit without light. He would see it through the\\r\\nventilator.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your\\r\\npistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of\\r\\nthe bed, and you in that chair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon\\r\\nthe bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the\\r\\nstump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left\\r\\nin darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a\\r\\nsound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my\\r\\ncompanion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same\\r\\nstate of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut\\r\\noff the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at\\r\\nour very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that\\r\\nthe cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the\\r\\ndeep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of\\r\\nan hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and\\r\\none and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for\\r\\nwhatever might befall.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the\\r\\ndirection of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was\\r\\nsucceeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.\\r\\nSomeone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle\\r\\nsound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the\\r\\nsmell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.\\r\\nThen suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,\\r\\nsoothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping\\r\\ncontinually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes\\r\\nsprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\\r\\nhis cane at the bell-pull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see it, Watson?\" he yelled. \"You see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I\\r\\nheard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my\\r\\nweary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which\\r\\nmy friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face\\r\\nwas deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had\\r\\nceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when\\r\\nsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most\\r\\nhorrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder\\r\\nand louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled\\r\\nin the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the\\r\\nvillage, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\\r\\nsleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I\\r\\nstood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it\\r\\nhad died away into the silence from which it rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can it mean?\" I gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It means that it is all over,\" Holmes answered. \"And perhaps,\\r\\nafter all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will\\r\\nenter Dr. Roylott\\'s room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the\\r\\ncorridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply\\r\\nfrom within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his\\r\\nheels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\\r\\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant\\r\\nbeam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.\\r\\nBeside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott\\r\\nclad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding\\r\\nbeneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.\\r\\nAcross his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we\\r\\nhad noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his\\r\\neyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the\\r\\nceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with\\r\\nbrownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his\\r\\nhead. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The band! the speckled band!\" whispered Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began\\r\\nto move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\\r\\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a swamp adder!\" cried Holmes; \"the deadliest snake in\\r\\nIndia. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence\\r\\ndoes, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls\\r\\ninto the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this\\r\\ncreature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to\\r\\nsome place of shelter and let the county police know what has\\r\\nhappened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\\'s lap,\\r\\nand throwing the noose round the reptile\\'s neck he drew it from\\r\\nits horrid perch and, carrying it at arm\\'s length, threw it into\\r\\nthe iron safe, which he closed upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of\\r\\nStoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a\\r\\nnarrative which has already run to too great a length by telling\\r\\nhow we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed\\r\\nher by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,\\r\\nof how the slow process of official inquiry came to the\\r\\nconclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly\\r\\nplaying with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn\\r\\nof the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back\\r\\nnext day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had,\" said he, \"come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\\r\\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\\r\\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of\\r\\nthe word \\'band,\\' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to\\r\\nexplain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of\\r\\nby the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an\\r\\nentirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly\\r\\nreconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me\\r\\nthat whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not\\r\\ncome either from the window or the door. My attention was\\r\\nspeedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this\\r\\nventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The\\r\\ndiscovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to\\r\\nthe floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\\r\\nthere as a bridge for something passing through the hole and\\r\\ncoming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,\\r\\nand when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was\\r\\nfurnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I\\r\\nwas probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of\\r\\npoison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical\\r\\ntest was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless\\r\\nman who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such\\r\\na poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be\\r\\nan advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could\\r\\ndistinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\\r\\nthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the\\r\\nwhistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning\\r\\nlight revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by\\r\\nthe use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.\\r\\nHe would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he\\r\\nthought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the\\r\\nrope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the\\r\\noccupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\\r\\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his\\r\\nroom. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in\\r\\nthe habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary\\r\\nin order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the\\r\\nsafe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to\\r\\nfinally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic\\r\\nclang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather\\r\\nhastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.\\r\\nHaving once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in\\r\\norder to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss\\r\\nas I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the\\r\\nlight and attacked it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the result of driving it through the ventilator.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master\\r\\nat the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and\\r\\nroused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person\\r\\nit saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.\\r\\nGrimesby Roylott\\'s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to\\r\\nweigh very heavily upon my conscience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER\\'S THUMB\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,\\r\\nthere were only two which I was the means of introducing to his\\r\\nnotice--that of Mr. Hatherley\\'s thumb, and that of Colonel\\r\\nWarburton\\'s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a\\r\\nfiner field for an acute and original observer, but the other was\\r\\nso strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that\\r\\nit may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it\\r\\ngave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of\\r\\nreasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story\\r\\nhas, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,\\r\\nlike all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when\\r\\nset forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the\\r\\nfacts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears\\r\\ngradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads\\r\\non to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a\\r\\ndeep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly\\r\\nserved to weaken the effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the summer of \\'89, not long after my marriage, that the\\r\\nevents occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned\\r\\nto civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker\\r\\nStreet rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally\\r\\neven persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come\\r\\nand visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I\\r\\nhappened to live at no very great distance from Paddington\\r\\nStation, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of\\r\\nthese, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was\\r\\nnever weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send\\r\\nme on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o\\'clock, I was awakened by\\r\\nthe maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come\\r\\nfrom Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I\\r\\ndressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases\\r\\nwere seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my\\r\\nold ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door\\r\\ntightly behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got him here,\" he whispered, jerking his thumb over his\\r\\nshoulder; \"he\\'s all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it, then?\" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was\\r\\nsome strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a new patient,\" he whispered. \"I thought I\\'d bring him\\r\\nround myself; then he couldn\\'t slip away. There he is, all safe\\r\\nand sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the\\r\\nsame as you.\" And off he went, this trusty tout, without even\\r\\ngiving me time to thank him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the\\r\\ntable. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a\\r\\nsoft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of\\r\\nhis hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all\\r\\nover with bloodstains. He was young, not more than\\r\\nfive-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but\\r\\nhe was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who\\r\\nwas suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his\\r\\nstrength of mind to control.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\" said he, \"but I\\r\\nhave had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by\\r\\ntrain this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I\\r\\nmight find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me\\r\\nhere. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon\\r\\nthe side-table.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI took it up and glanced at it. \"Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\\r\\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\" That was the name,\\r\\nstyle, and abode of my morning visitor. \"I regret that I have\\r\\nkept you waiting,\" said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \"You\\r\\nare fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself\\r\\na monotonous occupation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,\" said he, and\\r\\nlaughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,\\r\\nleaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical\\r\\ninstincts rose up against that laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop it!\" I cried; \"pull yourself together!\" and I poured out\\r\\nsome water from a caraffe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical\\r\\noutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis\\r\\nis over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very\\r\\nweary and pale-looking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been making a fool of myself,\" he gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all. Drink this.\" I dashed some brandy into the water,\\r\\nand the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s better!\" said he. \"And now, Doctor, perhaps you would\\r\\nkindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb\\r\\nused to be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even\\r\\nmy hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four\\r\\nprotruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the\\r\\nthumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from\\r\\nthe roots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried, \"this is a terrible injury. It must have\\r\\nbled considerably.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must\\r\\nhave been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that\\r\\nit was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very\\r\\ntightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\\r\\nprovince.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This has been done,\" said I, examining the wound, \"by a very\\r\\nheavy and sharp instrument.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A thing like a cleaver,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An accident, I presume?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By no means.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! a murderous attack?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very murderous indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You horrify me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered\\r\\nit over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back\\r\\nwithout wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How is that?\" I asked when I had finished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.\\r\\nI was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently\\r\\ntrying to your nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;\\r\\nbut, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing\\r\\nevidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they\\r\\nbelieved my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I\\r\\nhave not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,\\r\\neven if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so\\r\\nvague that it is a question whether justice will be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha!\" cried I, \"if it is anything in the nature of a problem\\r\\nwhich you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you\\r\\nto come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the\\r\\nofficial police.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I have heard of that fellow,\" answered my visitor, \"and I\\r\\nshould be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of\\r\\ncourse I must use the official police as well. Would you give me\\r\\nan introduction to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do better. I\\'ll take you round to him myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be immensely obliged to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to\\r\\nhave a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\\r\\ninstant.\" I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my\\r\\nwife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my\\r\\nnew acquaintance to Baker Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his\\r\\nsitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The\\r\\nTimes and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed\\r\\nof all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day\\r\\nbefore, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the\\r\\nmantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,\\r\\nordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.\\r\\nWhen it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the\\r\\nsofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of\\r\\nbrandy and water within his reach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,\\r\\nMr. Hatherley,\" said he. \"Pray, lie down there and make yourself\\r\\nabsolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are\\r\\ntired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said my patient, \"but I have felt another man since\\r\\nthe doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has\\r\\ncompleted the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable\\r\\ntime as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar\\r\\nexperiences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded\\r\\nexpression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat\\r\\nopposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story\\r\\nwhich our visitor detailed to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must know,\" said he, \"that I am an orphan and a bachelor,\\r\\nresiding alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a\\r\\nhydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my\\r\\nwork during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &\\r\\nMatheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,\\r\\nhaving served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of\\r\\nmoney through my poor father\\'s death, I determined to start in\\r\\nbusiness for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria\\r\\nStreet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in\\r\\nbusiness a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.\\r\\nDuring two years I have had three consultations and one small\\r\\njob, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought\\r\\nme. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from\\r\\nnine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my\\r\\nlittle den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to\\r\\nbelieve that I should never have any practice at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the\\r\\noffice, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who\\r\\nwished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with\\r\\nthe name of \\'Colonel Lysander Stark\\' engraved upon it. Close at\\r\\nhis heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle\\r\\nsize, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have\\r\\never seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose\\r\\nand chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over\\r\\nhis outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his\\r\\nnatural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his\\r\\nstep brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly\\r\\ndressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than\\r\\nthirty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Mr. Hatherley?\\' said he, with something of a German accent.\\r\\n\\'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man\\r\\nwho is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet\\r\\nand capable of preserving a secret.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an\\r\\naddress. \\'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just\\r\\nat this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both\\r\\nan orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'That is quite correct,\\' I answered; \\'but you will excuse me if\\r\\nI say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional\\r\\nqualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter\\r\\nthat you wished to speak to me?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to\\r\\nthe point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute\\r\\nsecrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and\\r\\nof course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than\\r\\nfrom one who lives in the bosom of his family.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'If I promise to keep a secret,\\' said I, \\'you may absolutely\\r\\ndepend upon my doing so.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I\\r\\nhad never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Do you promise, then?\\' said he at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, I promise.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No\\r\\nreference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I have already given you my word.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Very good.\\' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning\\r\\nacross the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was\\r\\nempty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'That\\'s all right,\\' said he, coming back. \\'I know that clerks are\\r\\nsometimes curious as to their master\\'s affairs. Now we can talk\\r\\nin safety.\\' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to\\r\\nstare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun\\r\\nto rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.\\r\\nEven my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from\\r\\nshowing my impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I beg that you will state your business, sir,\\' said I; \\'my time\\r\\nis of value.\\' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the\\r\\nwords came to my lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'How would fifty guineas for a night\\'s work suit you?\\' he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Most admirably.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I say a night\\'s work, but an hour\\'s would be nearer the mark. I\\r\\nsimply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which\\r\\nhas got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon\\r\\nset it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as\\r\\nthat?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last\\r\\ntrain.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Where to?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders\\r\\nof Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a\\r\\ntrain from Paddington which would bring you there at about\\r\\n11:15.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Very good.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'There is a drive, then?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good\\r\\nseven miles from Eyford Station.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there\\r\\nwould be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop\\r\\nthe night.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient\\r\\nhour?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to\\r\\nrecompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a\\r\\nyoung and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the\\r\\nvery heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would\\r\\nlike to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do\\r\\nso.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they\\r\\nwould be to me. \\'Not at all,\\' said I, \\'I shall be very happy to\\r\\naccommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to\\r\\nunderstand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to\\r\\ndo.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which\\r\\nwe have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I\\r\\nhave no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all\\r\\nlaid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from\\r\\neavesdroppers?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Entirely.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\r\\nfuller\\'s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found\\r\\nin one or two places in England?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I have heard so.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small\\r\\nplace--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to\\r\\ndiscover that there was a deposit of fuller\\'s-earth in one of my\\r\\nfields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a\\r\\ncomparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two\\r\\nvery much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,\\r\\nhowever, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were\\r\\nabsolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was\\r\\nquite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my\\r\\ninterest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,\\r\\nbut unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I\\r\\ntook a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they\\r\\nsuggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little\\r\\ndeposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would\\r\\nenable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been\\r\\ndoing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we\\r\\nerected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already\\r\\nexplained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the\\r\\nsubject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it\\r\\nonce became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our\\r\\nlittle house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts\\r\\ncame out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these\\r\\nfields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you\\r\\npromise me that you will not tell a human being that you are\\r\\ngoing to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I quite follow you,\\' said I. \\'The only point which I could not\\r\\nquite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press\\r\\nin excavating fuller\\'s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out\\r\\nlike gravel from a pit.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ah!\\' said he carelessly, \\'we have our own process. We compress\\r\\nthe earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing\\r\\nwhat they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully\\r\\ninto my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I\\r\\ntrust you.\\' He rose as he spoke. \\'I shall expect you, then, at\\r\\nEyford at 11:15.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I shall certainly be there.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And not a word to a soul.\\' He looked at me with a last long,\\r\\nquestioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank\\r\\ngrasp, he hurried from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very\\r\\nmuch astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission\\r\\nwhich had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was\\r\\nglad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked\\r\\nhad I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that\\r\\nthis order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face\\r\\nand manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon\\r\\nme, and I could not think that his explanation of the\\r\\nfuller\\'s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my\\r\\ncoming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell\\r\\nanyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate\\r\\na hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having\\r\\nobeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.\\r\\nHowever, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I\\r\\nreached the little dim-lit station after eleven o\\'clock. I was the\\r\\nonly passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the\\r\\nplatform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed\\r\\nout through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of\\r\\nthe morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a\\r\\nword he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door\\r\\nof which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either\\r\\nside, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the\\r\\nhorse could go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One horse?\" interjected Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, only one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you observe the colour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the\\r\\ncarriage. It was a chestnut.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tired-looking or fresh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, fresh and glossy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue\\r\\nyour most interesting statement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel\\r\\nLysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I\\r\\nshould think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the\\r\\ntime that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat\\r\\nat my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than\\r\\nonce when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me\\r\\nwith great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good\\r\\nin that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I\\r\\ntried to look out of the windows to see something of where we\\r\\nwere, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out\\r\\nnothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now\\r\\nand then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the\\r\\njourney, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the\\r\\nconversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the\\r\\nroad was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,\\r\\nand the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang\\r\\nout, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch\\r\\nwhich gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of\\r\\nthe carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the\\r\\nmost fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that\\r\\nI had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,\\r\\nand I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\\r\\ndrove away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled\\r\\nabout looking for matches and muttering under his breath.\\r\\nSuddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a\\r\\nlong, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew\\r\\nbroader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she\\r\\nheld above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.\\r\\nI could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which\\r\\nthe light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich\\r\\nmaterial. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as\\r\\nthough asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\\r\\ngruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly\\r\\nfell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered\\r\\nsomething in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room\\r\\nfrom whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the\\r\\nlamp in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a\\r\\nfew minutes,\\' said he, throwing open another door. It was a\\r\\nquiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the\\r\\ncentre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel\\r\\nStark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the\\r\\ndoor. \\'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,\\' said he, and\\r\\nvanished into the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my\\r\\nignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises\\r\\non science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked\\r\\nacross to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of\\r\\nthe country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded\\r\\nacross it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old\\r\\nclock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise\\r\\neverything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began\\r\\nto steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were\\r\\nthey doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And\\r\\nwhere was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was\\r\\nall I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no\\r\\nidea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns,\\r\\nwere within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,\\r\\nafter all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,\\r\\nthat we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,\\r\\nhumming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling\\r\\nthat I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the\\r\\nutter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman\\r\\nwas standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind\\r\\nher, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and\\r\\nbeautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with\\r\\nfear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one\\r\\nshaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few\\r\\nwhispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,\\r\\nlike those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I would go,\\' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to\\r\\nspeak calmly; \\'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no\\r\\ngood for you to do.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'But, madam,\\' said I, \\'I have not yet done what I came for. I\\r\\ncannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'It is not worth your while to wait,\\' she went on. \\'You can pass\\r\\nthrough the door; no one hinders.\\' And then, seeing that I smiled\\r\\nand shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and\\r\\nmade a step forward, with her hands wrung together. \\'For the love\\r\\nof Heaven!\\' she whispered, \\'get away from here before it is too\\r\\nlate!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to\\r\\nengage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I\\r\\nthought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of\\r\\nthe unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to\\r\\ngo for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried\\r\\nout my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This\\r\\nwoman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout\\r\\nbearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I\\r\\ncared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention\\r\\nof remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties\\r\\nwhen a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps\\r\\nwas heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up\\r\\nher hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and\\r\\nas noiselessly as she had come.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man\\r\\nwith a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double\\r\\nchin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'This is my secretary and manager,\\' said the colonel. \\'By the\\r\\nway, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just\\r\\nnow. I fear that you have felt the draught.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'On the contrary,\\' said I, \\'I opened the door myself because I\\r\\nfelt the room to be a little close.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \\'Perhaps we had\\r\\nbetter proceed to business, then,\\' said he. \\'Mr. Ferguson and I\\r\\nwill take you up to see the machine.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, no, it is in the house.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What, you dig fuller\\'s-earth in the house?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.\\r\\nAll we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us\\r\\nknow what is wrong with it.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the\\r\\nfat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,\\r\\nwith corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little\\r\\nlow doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the\\r\\ngenerations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no\\r\\nsigns of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster\\r\\nwas peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in\\r\\ngreen, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an\\r\\nair as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the\\r\\nlady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon\\r\\nmy two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent\\r\\nman, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at\\r\\nleast a fellow-countryman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which\\r\\nhe unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three\\r\\nof us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,\\r\\nand the colonel ushered me in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'We are now,\\' said he, \\'actually within the hydraulic press, and\\r\\nit would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were\\r\\nto turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the\\r\\nend of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of\\r\\nmany tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns\\r\\nof water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and\\r\\nmultiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine\\r\\ngoes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working\\r\\nof it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will\\r\\nhave the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set\\r\\nit right.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very\\r\\nthoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of\\r\\nexercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and\\r\\npressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by\\r\\nthe whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed\\r\\na regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An\\r\\nexamination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was\\r\\nround the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to\\r\\nfill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause\\r\\nof the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who\\r\\nfollowed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical\\r\\nquestions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I\\r\\nhad made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\\r\\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.\\r\\nIt was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\\'s-earth\\r\\nwas the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose\\r\\nthat so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a\\r\\npurpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a\\r\\nlarge iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a\\r\\ncrust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was\\r\\nscraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a\\r\\nmuttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the\\r\\ncolonel looking down at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'What are you doing there?\\' he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as\\r\\nthat which he had told me. \\'I was admiring your fuller\\'s-earth,\\'\\r\\nsaid I; \\'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to\\r\\nyour machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it\\r\\nwas used.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of\\r\\nmy speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in\\r\\nhis grey eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Very well,\\' said he, \\'you shall know all about the machine.\\' He\\r\\ntook a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key\\r\\nin the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it\\r\\nwas quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and\\r\\nshoves. \\'Hullo!\\' I yelled. \\'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my\\r\\nheart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish\\r\\nof the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp\\r\\nstill stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining\\r\\nthe trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming\\r\\ndown upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than\\r\\nmyself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a\\r\\nshapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and\\r\\ndragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let\\r\\nme out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my\\r\\ncries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with\\r\\nmy hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it\\r\\nflashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\\r\\nvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my\\r\\nface the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to\\r\\nthink of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and\\r\\nyet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black\\r\\nshadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand\\r\\nerect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope\\r\\nback to my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the\\r\\nwalls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw\\r\\na thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which\\r\\nbroadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For\\r\\nan instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door\\r\\nwhich led away from death. The next instant I threw myself\\r\\nthrough, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had\\r\\nclosed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few\\r\\nmoments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me\\r\\nhow narrow had been my escape.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and\\r\\nI found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,\\r\\nwhile a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,\\r\\nwhile she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend\\r\\nwhose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Come! come!\\' she cried breathlessly. \\'They will be here in a\\r\\nmoment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste\\r\\nthe so-precious time, but come!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to\\r\\nmy feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding\\r\\nstair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we\\r\\nreached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of\\r\\ntwo voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we\\r\\nwere and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about\\r\\nher like one  who is at her wit\\'s end. Then she threw open a door\\r\\nwhich led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon\\r\\nwas shining brightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'It is your only chance,\\' said she. \\'It is high, but it may be\\r\\nthat you can jump it.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\\r\\npassage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark\\r\\nrushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a\\r\\nbutcher\\'s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,\\r\\nflung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and\\r\\nwholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be\\r\\nmore than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I\\r\\nhesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between\\r\\nmy saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used,\\r\\nthen at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.\\r\\nThe thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at\\r\\nthe door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round\\r\\nhim and tried to hold him back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Fritz! Fritz!\\' she cried in English, \\'remember your promise\\r\\nafter the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be\\r\\nsilent! Oh, he will be silent!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You are mad, Elise!\\' he shouted, struggling to break away from\\r\\nher. \\'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me\\r\\npass, I say!\\' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the\\r\\nwindow, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and\\r\\nwas hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was\\r\\nconscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the\\r\\ngarden below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\\r\\nrushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I\\r\\nunderstood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,\\r\\nhowever, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.\\r\\nI glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and\\r\\nthen, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and\\r\\nthat the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my\\r\\nhandkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my\\r\\nears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the\\r\\nrose-bushes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been\\r\\na very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\\r\\nbreaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with\\r\\ndew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded\\r\\nthumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the\\r\\nparticulars of my night\\'s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with\\r\\nthe feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But\\r\\nto my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house\\r\\nnor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the\\r\\nhedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a\\r\\nlong building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the\\r\\nvery station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were\\r\\nit not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed\\r\\nduring those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning\\r\\ntrain. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The\\r\\nsame porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I\\r\\narrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel\\r\\nLysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a\\r\\ncarriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was\\r\\nthere a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three\\r\\nmiles off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined\\r\\nto wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the\\r\\npolice. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first\\r\\nto have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to\\r\\nbring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do\\r\\nexactly what you advise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to\\r\\nthis extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down\\r\\nfrom the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he\\r\\nplaced his cuttings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is an advertisement which will interest you,\" said he. \"It\\r\\nappeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:\\r\\n\\'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged\\r\\ntwenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten\\r\\no\\'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was\\r\\ndressed in,\\' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that\\r\\nthe colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried my patient. \"Then that explains what the\\r\\ngirl said.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\\r\\ndesperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should\\r\\nstand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out\\r\\npirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,\\r\\nevery moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall\\r\\ngo down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for\\r\\nEyford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train\\r\\ntogether, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.\\r\\nThere were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector\\r\\nBradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.\\r\\nBradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the\\r\\nseat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford\\r\\nfor its centre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There you are,\" said he. \"That circle is drawn at a radius of\\r\\nten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere\\r\\nnear that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was an hour\\'s good drive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you\\r\\nwere unconscious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having\\r\\nbeen lifted and conveyed somewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What I cannot understand,\" said I, \"is why they should have\\r\\nspared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.\\r\\nPerhaps the villain was softened by the woman\\'s entreaties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face\\r\\nin my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,\" said Bradstreet. \"Well, I\\r\\nhave drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon\\r\\nit the folk that we are in search of are to be found.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I could lay my finger on it,\" said Holmes quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, now!\" cried the inspector, \"you have formed your\\r\\nopinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is\\r\\nsouth, for the country is more deserted there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I say east,\" said my patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am for west,\" remarked the plain-clothes man. \"There are\\r\\nseveral quiet little villages up there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I am for north,\" said I, \"because there are no hills there,\\r\\nand our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up\\r\\nany.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" cried the inspector, laughing; \"it\\'s a very pretty\\r\\ndiversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do\\r\\nyou give your casting vote to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are all wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we can\\'t all be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.\" He placed his finger in the\\r\\ncentre of the circle. \"This is where we shall find them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the twelve-mile drive?\" gasped Hatherley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the\\r\\nhorse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that\\r\\nif it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\" observed Bradstreet\\r\\nthoughtfully. \"Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature\\r\\nof this gang.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None at all,\" said Holmes. \"They are coiners on a large scale,\\r\\nand have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the\\r\\nplace of silver.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\"\\r\\nsaid the inspector. \"They have been turning out half-crowns by\\r\\nthe thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could\\r\\nget no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that\\r\\nshowed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this\\r\\nlucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not\\r\\ndestined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into\\r\\nEyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed\\r\\nup from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and\\r\\nhung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A house on fire?\" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off\\r\\nagain on its way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir!\" said the station-master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When did it break out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,\\r\\nand the whole place is in a blaze.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whose house is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dr. Becher\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me,\" broke in the engineer, \"is Dr. Becher a German, very\\r\\nthin, with a long, sharp nose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. \"No, sir, Dr. Becher is an\\r\\nEnglishman, and there isn\\'t a man in the parish who has a\\r\\nbetter-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,\\r\\na patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as\\r\\nif a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\\r\\nhastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low\\r\\nhill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in\\r\\nfront of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in\\r\\nthe garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to\\r\\nkeep the flames under.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s it!\" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \"There is\\r\\nthe gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That\\r\\nsecond window is the one that I jumped from.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, at least,\" said Holmes, \"you have had your revenge upon\\r\\nthem. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,\\r\\nwhen it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,\\r\\nthough no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to\\r\\nobserve it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for\\r\\nyour friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are\\r\\na good hundred miles off by now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Holmes\\' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this\\r\\nno word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the\\r\\nsinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a\\r\\npeasant had met a cart containing several people and some very\\r\\nbulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but\\r\\nthere all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\\'\\r\\ningenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their\\r\\nwhereabouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements\\r\\nwhich they had found within, and still more so by discovering a\\r\\nnewly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.\\r\\nAbout sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and\\r\\nthey subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,\\r\\nand the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save\\r\\nsome twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of\\r\\nthe machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so\\r\\ndearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored\\r\\nin an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have\\r\\nexplained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been\\r\\nalready referred to.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to\\r\\nthe spot where he recovered his senses might have remained\\r\\nforever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a\\r\\nvery plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two\\r\\npersons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other\\r\\nunusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the\\r\\nsilent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his\\r\\ncompanion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out\\r\\nof the way of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return\\r\\nonce more to London, \"it has been a pretty business for me! I\\r\\nhave lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what\\r\\nhave I gained?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Experience,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"Indirectly it may be of\\r\\nvalue, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the\\r\\nreputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your\\r\\nexistence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have\\r\\nlong ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles\\r\\nin which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have\\r\\neclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the\\r\\ngossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to\\r\\nbelieve, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to\\r\\nthe general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a\\r\\nconsiderable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no\\r\\nmemoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of\\r\\nthis remarkable episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I\\r\\nwas still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came\\r\\nhome from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table\\r\\nwaiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather\\r\\nhad taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and\\r\\nthe Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as\\r\\na relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.\\r\\nWith my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had\\r\\nsurrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,\\r\\nsaturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and\\r\\nlay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\\r\\nenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\\'s\\r\\nnoble correspondent could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is a very fashionable epistle,\" I remarked as he entered.\\r\\n\"Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a\\r\\nfish-monger and a tide-waiter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\" he\\r\\nanswered, smiling, \"and the humbler are usually the more\\r\\ninteresting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social\\r\\nsummonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not social, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, distinctly professional.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And from a noble client?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of the highest in England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, I congratulate you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my\\r\\nclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his\\r\\ncase. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be\\r\\nwanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the\\r\\npapers diligently of late, have you not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It looks like it,\" said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in\\r\\nthe corner. \"I have had nothing else to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I\\r\\nread nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The\\r\\nlatter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent\\r\\nevents so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his\\r\\nwedding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord\\r\\nSt. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn\\r\\nover these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.\\r\\nThis is what he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I\\r\\nmay place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I\\r\\nhave determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you\\r\\nin reference to the very painful event which has occurred in\\r\\nconnection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is\\r\\nacting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no\\r\\nobjection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that\\r\\nit might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\\'clock in\\r\\nthe afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that\\r\\ntime, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of\\r\\nparamount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,\\r\\nand the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink\\r\\nupon the outer side of his right little finger,\" remarked Holmes\\r\\nas he folded up the epistle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He says four o\\'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an\\r\\nhour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon\\r\\nthe subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in\\r\\ntheir order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client\\r\\nis.\" He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of\\r\\nreference beside the mantelpiece. \"Here he is,\" said he, sitting\\r\\ndown and flattening it out upon his knee. \"\\'Lord Robert Walsingham\\r\\nde Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.\\' Hum! \\'Arms:\\r\\nAzure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.\\'\\r\\nHe\\'s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was\\r\\nUnder-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The\\r\\nDuke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.\\r\\nThey inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on\\r\\nthe distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in\\r\\nall this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something\\r\\nmore solid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\" said I,\\r\\n\"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as\\r\\nremarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew\\r\\nthat you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the\\r\\nintrusion of other matters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square\\r\\nfurniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it\\r\\nwas obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your\\r\\nnewspaper selections.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal\\r\\ncolumn of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks\\r\\nback: \\'A marriage has been arranged,\\' it says, \\'and will, if\\r\\nrumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert\\r\\nSt. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty\\r\\nDoran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San\\r\\nFrancisco, Cal., U.S.A.\\' That is all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Terse and to the point,\" remarked Holmes, stretching his long,\\r\\nthin legs towards the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society\\r\\npapers of the same week. Ah, here it is: \\'There will soon be a\\r\\ncall for protection in the marriage market, for the present\\r\\nfree-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home\\r\\nproduct. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great\\r\\nBritain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across\\r\\nthe Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last\\r\\nweek to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by\\r\\nthese charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself\\r\\nfor over twenty years proof against the little god\\'s arrows, has\\r\\nnow definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty\\r\\nDoran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss\\r\\nDoran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much\\r\\nattention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,\\r\\nand it is currently reported that her dowry will run to\\r\\nconsiderably over the six figures, with expectancies for the\\r\\nfuture. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has\\r\\nbeen compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,\\r\\nand as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small\\r\\nestate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress\\r\\nis not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to\\r\\nmake the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a\\r\\nBritish peeress.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything else?\" asked Holmes, yawning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post\\r\\nto say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it\\r\\nwould be at St. George\\'s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen\\r\\nintimate friends would be invited, and that the party would\\r\\nreturn to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been\\r\\ntaken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on\\r\\nWednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had\\r\\ntaken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord\\r\\nBackwater\\'s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices\\r\\nwhich appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Before the what?\" asked Holmes with a start.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The vanishing of the lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When did she vanish, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the wedding breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite\\r\\ndramatic, in fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during\\r\\nthe honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt\\r\\nas this. Pray let me have the details.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I warn you that they are very incomplete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps we may make them less so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a\\r\\nmorning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is\\r\\nheaded, \\'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\\':\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the\\r\\ngreatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which\\r\\nhave taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as\\r\\nshortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the\\r\\nprevious morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to\\r\\nconfirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently\\r\\nfloating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush\\r\\nthe matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it\\r\\nthat no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what\\r\\nis a common subject for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\\'s, Hanover\\r\\nSquare, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the\\r\\nfather of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,\\r\\nLord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the\\r\\nyounger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia\\r\\nWhittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of\\r\\nMr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been\\r\\nprepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a\\r\\nwoman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to\\r\\nforce her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging\\r\\nthat she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a\\r\\npainful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler\\r\\nand the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house\\r\\nbefore this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast\\r\\nwith the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and\\r\\nretired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some\\r\\ncomment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that\\r\\nshe had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an\\r\\nulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the\\r\\nfootmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus\\r\\napparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,\\r\\nbelieving her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his\\r\\ndaughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\\r\\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with\\r\\nthe police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which\\r\\nwill probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very\\r\\nsingular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing\\r\\nhad transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There\\r\\nare rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the\\r\\npolice have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the\\r\\noriginal disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some\\r\\nother motive, she may have been concerned in the strange\\r\\ndisappearance of the bride.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is that all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is\\r\\na suggestive one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it is--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,\\r\\nhas actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a\\r\\ndanseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom\\r\\nfor some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole\\r\\ncase is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the\\r\\npublic press.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would\\r\\nnot have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,\\r\\nWatson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I\\r\\nhave no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not\\r\\ndream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,\\r\\nif only as a check to my own memory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Robert St. Simon,\" announced our page-boy, throwing open\\r\\nthe door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,\\r\\nhigh-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about\\r\\nthe mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose\\r\\npleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His\\r\\nmanner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue\\r\\nimpression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little\\r\\nbend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off\\r\\nhis very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin\\r\\nupon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of\\r\\nfoppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,\\r\\nyellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.\\r\\nHe advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to\\r\\nright, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his\\r\\ngolden eyeglasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-day, Lord St. Simon,\" said Holmes, rising and bowing. \"Pray\\r\\ntake the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\r\\nWatson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this\\r\\nmatter over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,\\r\\nMr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you\\r\\nhave already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,\\r\\nthough I presume that they were hardly from the same class of\\r\\nsociety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I am descending.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg pardon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My last client of the sort was a king.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The King of Scandinavia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! Had he lost his wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can understand,\" said Holmes suavely, \"that I extend to the\\r\\naffairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to\\r\\nyou in yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course! Very right! very right! I\\'m sure I beg pardon. As to\\r\\nmy own case, I am ready to give you any information which may\\r\\nassist you in forming an opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public\\r\\nprints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this\\r\\narticle, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \"Yes, it is correct, as far as it\\r\\ngoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could\\r\\noffer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most\\r\\ndirectly by questioning you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In San Francisco, a year ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were travelling in the States?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you become engaged then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you were on a friendly footing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was\\r\\namused.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her father is very rich?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how did he make his money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,\\r\\ninvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady\\'s--your\\r\\nwife\\'s character?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down\\r\\ninto the fire. \"You see, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"my wife was\\r\\ntwenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she\\r\\nran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or\\r\\nmountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than\\r\\nfrom the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,\\r\\nwith a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of\\r\\ntraditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She\\r\\nis swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her\\r\\nresolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the\\r\\nname which I have the honour to bear\"--he gave a little stately\\r\\ncough--\"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I\\r\\nbelieve that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that\\r\\nanything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you her photograph?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I brought this with me.\" He opened a locket and showed us the\\r\\nfull face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an\\r\\nivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect\\r\\nof the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the\\r\\nexquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he\\r\\nclosed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\r\\nacquaintance?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I\\r\\nmet her several times, became engaged to her, and have now\\r\\nmarried her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a\\r\\nfait accompli?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really have made no inquiries on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\\r\\nwedding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was she in good spirits?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our\\r\\nfuture lives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the\\r\\nwedding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the\\r\\nceremony.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did you observe any change in her then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had\\r\\never seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident\\r\\nhowever, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible\\r\\nbearing upon the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray let us have it, for all that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards\\r\\nthe vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it\\r\\nfell over into the pew. There was a moment\\'s delay, but the\\r\\ngentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not\\r\\nappear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of\\r\\nthe matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our\\r\\nway home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of\\r\\nthe general public were present, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is\\r\\nopen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This gentleman was not one of your wife\\'s friends?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\\r\\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But\\r\\nreally I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less\\r\\ncheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do\\r\\non re-entering her father\\'s house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw her in conversation with her maid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who is her maid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California\\r\\nwith her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A confidential servant?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed\\r\\nher to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they\\r\\nlook upon these things in a different way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long did she speak to this Alice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did not overhear what they said?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady St. Simon said something about \\'jumping a claim.\\' She was\\r\\naccustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she\\r\\nmeant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your\\r\\nwife do when she finished speaking to her maid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She walked into the breakfast-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On your arm?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.\\r\\nThen, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose\\r\\nhurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She\\r\\nnever came back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to\\r\\nher room, covered her bride\\'s dress with a long ulster, put on a\\r\\nbonnet, and went out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\\r\\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who\\r\\nhad already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\\'s house that\\r\\nmorning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,\\r\\nand your relations to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.\\r\\n\"We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on\\r\\na very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have\\r\\nnot treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of\\r\\ncomplaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.\\r\\nFlora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and\\r\\ndevotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she\\r\\nheard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the\\r\\nreason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I\\r\\nfeared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to\\r\\nMr. Doran\\'s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to\\r\\npush her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my\\r\\nwife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the\\r\\npossibility of something of the sort, and I had two police\\r\\nfellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.\\r\\nShe was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a\\r\\nrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did your wife hear all this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, thank goodness, she did not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as\\r\\nso serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid\\r\\nsome terrible trap for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it is a possible supposition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think so, too?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon\\r\\nthis as likely?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray\\r\\nwhat is your own theory as to what took place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I\\r\\nhave given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may\\r\\nsay that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of\\r\\nthis affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a\\r\\nsocial stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous\\r\\ndisturbance in my wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I\\r\\nwill not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to\\r\\nwithout success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\" said\\r\\nHolmes, smiling. \"And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have\\r\\nnearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the\\r\\nbreakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We could see the other side of the road and the Park.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.\\r\\nI shall communicate with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\" said our\\r\\nclient, rising.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have solved it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eh? What was that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say that I have solved it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where, then, is my wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \"I am afraid that it will take\\r\\nwiser heads than yours or mine,\" he remarked, and bowing in a\\r\\nstately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting\\r\\nit on a level with his own,\" said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \"I\\r\\nthink that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all\\r\\nthis cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the\\r\\ncase before our client came into the room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I\\r\\nremarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination\\r\\nserved to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial\\r\\nevidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a\\r\\ntrout in the milk, to quote Thoreau\\'s example.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I have heard all that you have heard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which\\r\\nserves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some\\r\\nyears back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich\\r\\nthe year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these\\r\\ncases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!\\r\\nYou will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are\\r\\ncigars in the box.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,\\r\\nwhich gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a\\r\\nblack canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated\\r\\nhimself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s up, then?\" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \"You\\r\\nlook dissatisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage\\r\\ncase. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really! You surprise me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip\\r\\nthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And very wet it seems to have made you,\" said Holmes laying his\\r\\nhand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In heaven\\'s name, what for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\" he\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why? What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in\\r\\nthe one as in the other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \"I suppose you\\r\\nknow all about it,\" he snarled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in\\r\\nthe matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it very unlikely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found\\r\\nthis in it?\" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the\\r\\nfloor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin\\r\\nshoes and a bride\\'s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked\\r\\nin water. \"There,\" said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the\\r\\ntop of the pile. \"There is a little nut for you to crack, Master\\r\\nHolmes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.\\r\\n\"You dragged them from the Serpentine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.\\r\\nThey have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me\\r\\nthat if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man\\'s body is to be found\\r\\nin the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope\\r\\nto arrive at through this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid that you will find it difficult.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you, indeed, now?\" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \"I\\r\\nam afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your\\r\\ndeductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as\\r\\nmany minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the\\r\\ncard-case is a note. And here is the very note.\" He slapped it\\r\\ndown upon the table in front of him. \"Listen to this: \\'You will\\r\\nsee me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.\\' Now my theory all\\r\\nalong has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora\\r\\nMillar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was\\r\\nresponsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her\\r\\ninitials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped\\r\\ninto her hand at the door and which lured her within their\\r\\nreach.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good, Lestrade,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"You really are\\r\\nvery fine indeed. Let me see it.\" He took up the paper in a\\r\\nlistless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he\\r\\ngave a little cry of satisfaction. \"This is indeed important,\"\\r\\nsaid he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! you find it so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \"Why,\" he\\r\\nshrieked, \"you\\'re looking at the wrong side!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary, this is the right side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The right side? You\\'re mad! Here is the note written in pencil\\r\\nover here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel\\r\\nbill, which interests me deeply.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\" said Lestrade.\\r\\n\"\\'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.\\r\\n6d., glass sherry, 8d.\\' I see nothing in that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the\\r\\nnote, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I\\r\\ncongratulate you again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve wasted time enough,\" said Lestrade, rising. \"I believe in\\r\\nhard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.\\r\\nGood-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom\\r\\nof the matter first.\" He gathered up the garments, thrust them\\r\\ninto the bag, and made for the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just one hint to you, Lestrade,\" drawled Holmes before his rival\\r\\nvanished; \"I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady\\r\\nSt. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any\\r\\nsuch person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,\\r\\ntapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and\\r\\nhurried away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on\\r\\nhis overcoat. \"There is something in what the fellow says about\\r\\noutdoor work,\" he remarked, \"so I think, Watson, that I must\\r\\nleave you to your papers for a little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was after five o\\'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had\\r\\nno time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a\\r\\nconfectioner\\'s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked\\r\\nwith the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and\\r\\npresently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean\\r\\nlittle cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble\\r\\nlodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold\\r\\nwoodcock, a pheasant, a p\\xe2t\\xe9 de foie gras pie with a group of\\r\\nancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,\\r\\nmy two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian\\r\\nNights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid\\r\\nfor and were ordered to this address.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before nine o\\'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the\\r\\nroom. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his\\r\\neye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his\\r\\nconclusions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have laid the supper, then,\" he said, rubbing his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\" said he. \"I\\r\\nam surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I\\r\\nfancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,\\r\\ndangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very\\r\\nperturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My messenger reached you, then?\" asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.\\r\\nHave you good authority for what you say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The best possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his\\r\\nforehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What will the Duke say,\" he murmured, \"when he hears that one of\\r\\nthe family has been subjected to such humiliation?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\r\\nhumiliation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the\\r\\nlady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of\\r\\ndoing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she\\r\\nhad no one to advise her at such a crisis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a slight, sir, a public slight,\" said Lord St. Simon,\\r\\ntapping his fingers upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so\\r\\nunprecedented a position.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have\\r\\nbeen shamefully used.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that I heard a ring,\" said Holmes. \"Yes, there are steps\\r\\non the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view\\r\\nof the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here\\r\\nwho may be more successful.\" He opened the door and ushered in a\\r\\nlady and gentleman. \"Lord St. Simon,\" said he \"allow me to\\r\\nintroduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I\\r\\nthink, you have already met.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his\\r\\nseat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand\\r\\nthrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended\\r\\ndignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out\\r\\nher hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was\\r\\nas well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was\\r\\none which it was hard to resist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re angry, Robert,\" said she. \"Well, I guess you have every\\r\\ncause to be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray make no apology to me,\" said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I\\r\\nshould have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of\\r\\nrattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just\\r\\ndidn\\'t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn\\'t\\r\\nfall down and do a faint right there before the altar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave\\r\\nthe room while you explain this matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I may give an opinion,\" remarked the strange gentleman,\\r\\n\"we\\'ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business\\r\\nalready. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to\\r\\nhear the rights of it.\" He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,\\r\\nclean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I\\'ll tell our story right away,\" said the lady. \"Frank here\\r\\nand I met in \\'84, in McQuire\\'s camp, near the Rockies, where pa\\r\\nwas working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;\\r\\nbut then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,\\r\\nwhile poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to\\r\\nnothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa\\r\\nwouldn\\'t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took\\r\\nme away to \\'Frisco. Frank wouldn\\'t throw up his hand, though; so\\r\\nhe followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything\\r\\nabout it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\\r\\nfixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and\\r\\nmake his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had\\r\\nas much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of\\r\\ntime and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.\\r\\n\\'Why shouldn\\'t we be married right away, then,\\' said he, \\'and\\r\\nthen I will feel sure of you; and I won\\'t claim to be your\\r\\nhusband until I come back?\\' Well, we talked it over, and he had\\r\\nfixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,\\r\\nthat we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek\\r\\nhis fortune, and I went back to pa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then\\r\\nhe went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New\\r\\nMexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a\\r\\nminers\\' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was\\r\\nmy Frank\\'s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was\\r\\nvery sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took\\r\\nme to half the doctors in \\'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a\\r\\nyear and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really\\r\\ndead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \\'Frisco, and we came to London,\\r\\nand a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt\\r\\nall the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place\\r\\nin my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\\'d have done\\r\\nmy duty by him. We can\\'t command our love, but we can our\\r\\nactions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make\\r\\nhim just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may\\r\\nimagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I\\r\\nglanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the\\r\\nfirst pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked\\r\\nagain there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as\\r\\nif to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I\\r\\ndidn\\'t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the\\r\\nwords of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my\\r\\near. I didn\\'t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\\r\\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to\\r\\nknow what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to\\r\\ntell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,\\r\\nand I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on\\r\\nthe way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the\\r\\nnote into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a\\r\\nline asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.\\r\\nOf course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now\\r\\nto him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,\\r\\nand had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but\\r\\nto get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to\\r\\nhave spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before\\r\\nhis mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to\\r\\nrun away and explain afterwards. I hadn\\'t been at the table ten\\r\\nminutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of\\r\\nthe road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.\\r\\nI slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman\\r\\ncame talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to\\r\\nme--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little\\r\\nsecret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away\\r\\nfrom her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and\\r\\naway we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and\\r\\nthat was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank\\r\\nhad been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to\\r\\n\\'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to\\r\\nEngland, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the\\r\\nvery morning of my second wedding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw it in a paper,\" explained the American. \"It gave the name\\r\\nand the church but not where the lady lived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all\\r\\nfor openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I\\r\\nshould like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just\\r\\nsending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It\\r\\nwas awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting\\r\\nround that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So\\r\\nFrank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of\\r\\nthem, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away\\r\\nsomewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we\\r\\nshould have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\\r\\ngentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how\\r\\nhe found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very\\r\\nclearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and\\r\\nthat we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so\\r\\nsecret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord\\r\\nSt. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at\\r\\nonce. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if\\r\\nI have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very\\r\\nmeanly of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but\\r\\nhad listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this\\r\\nlong narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, \"but it is not my custom to discuss my most\\r\\nintimate personal affairs in this public manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you won\\'t forgive me? You won\\'t shake hands before I go?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\" He put out\\r\\nhis hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had hoped,\" suggested Holmes, \"that you would have joined us\\r\\nin a friendly supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that there you ask a little too much,\" responded his\\r\\nLordship. \"I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent\\r\\ndevelopments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over\\r\\nthem. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a\\r\\nvery good-night.\" He included us all in a sweeping bow and\\r\\nstalked out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your\\r\\ncompany,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"It is always a joy to meet an\\r\\nAmerican, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the\\r\\nfolly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone\\r\\nyears will not prevent our children from being some day citizens\\r\\nof the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a\\r\\nquartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The case has been an interesting one,\" remarked Holmes when our\\r\\nvisitors had left us, \"because it serves to show very clearly how\\r\\nsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight\\r\\nseems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural\\r\\nthan the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing\\r\\nstranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.\\r\\nLestrade of Scotland Yard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that\\r\\nthe lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,\\r\\nthe other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of\\r\\nreturning home. Obviously something had occurred during the\\r\\nmorning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that\\r\\nsomething be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was\\r\\nout, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she\\r\\nseen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America\\r\\nbecause she had spent so short a time in this country that she\\r\\ncould hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence\\r\\nover her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change\\r\\nher plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a\\r\\nprocess of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an\\r\\nAmerican. Then who could this American be, and why should he\\r\\npossess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might\\r\\nbe a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in\\r\\nrough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got\\r\\nbefore I ever heard Lord St. Simon\\'s narrative. When he told us\\r\\nof a man in a pew, of the change in the bride\\'s manner, of so\\r\\ntransparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a\\r\\nbouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very\\r\\nsignificant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners\\' parlance\\r\\nmeans taking possession of that which another person has a prior\\r\\nclaim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had\\r\\ngone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a\\r\\nprevious husband--the chances being in favour of the latter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how in the world did you find them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held\\r\\ninformation in his hands the value of which he did not himself\\r\\nknow. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,\\r\\nbut more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had\\r\\nsettled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you deduce the select?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence\\r\\nfor a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive\\r\\nhotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.\\r\\nIn the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I\\r\\nlearned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an\\r\\nAmerican gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking\\r\\nover the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I\\r\\nhad seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded\\r\\nto 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate\\r\\nenough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them\\r\\nsome paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be\\r\\nbetter in every way that they should make their position a little\\r\\nclearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in\\r\\nparticular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I\\r\\nmade him keep the appointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But with no very good result,\" I remarked. \"His conduct was\\r\\ncertainly not very gracious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Watson,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"perhaps you would not be\\r\\nvery gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and\\r\\nwedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of\\r\\nfortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully\\r\\nand thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in\\r\\nthe same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for\\r\\nthe only problem we have still to solve is how to while away\\r\\nthese bleak autumnal evenings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holmes,\" said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking\\r\\ndown the street, \"here is a madman coming along. It seems rather\\r\\nsad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands\\r\\nin the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It\\r\\nwas a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day\\r\\nbefore still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the\\r\\nwintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed\\r\\ninto a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and\\r\\non the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as\\r\\nwhen it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but\\r\\nwas still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer\\r\\npassengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the\\r\\nMetropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman\\r\\nwhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a\\r\\nmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was\\r\\ndressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining\\r\\nhat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet\\r\\nhis actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress\\r\\nand features, for he was running hard, with occasional little\\r\\nsprings, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to\\r\\nset any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and\\r\\ndown, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most\\r\\nextraordinary contortions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What on earth can be the matter with him?\" I asked. \"He is\\r\\nlooking up at the numbers of the houses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe that he is coming here,\" said Holmes, rubbing his\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I\\r\\nthink that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\" As\\r\\nhe spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and\\r\\npulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the\\r\\nclanging.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still\\r\\ngesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in\\r\\nhis eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and\\r\\npity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his\\r\\nbody and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the\\r\\nextreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his\\r\\nfeet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we\\r\\nboth rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting\\r\\nbeside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,\\r\\nsoothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\" said he.\\r\\n\"You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have\\r\\nrecovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into\\r\\nany little problem which you may submit to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting\\r\\nagainst his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his\\r\\nbrow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt you think me mad?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see that you have had some great trouble,\" responded Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my\\r\\nreason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might\\r\\nhave faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet\\r\\nborne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;\\r\\nbut the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have\\r\\nbeen enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.\\r\\nThe very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found\\r\\nout of this horrible affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray compose yourself, sir,\" said Holmes, \"and let me have a\\r\\nclear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My name,\" answered our visitor, \"is probably familiar to your\\r\\nears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &\\r\\nStevenson, of Threadneedle Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior\\r\\npartner in the second largest private banking concern in the City\\r\\nof London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the\\r\\nforemost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We\\r\\nwaited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced\\r\\nhimself to tell his story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I feel that time is of value,\" said he; \"that is why I hastened\\r\\nhere when the police inspector suggested that I should secure\\r\\nyour co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and\\r\\nhurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this\\r\\nsnow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who\\r\\ntakes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the\\r\\nfacts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\\r\\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative\\r\\ninvestments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection\\r\\nand the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means\\r\\nof laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security\\r\\nis unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction\\r\\nduring the last few years, and there are many noble families to\\r\\nwhom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their\\r\\npictures, libraries, or plate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a\\r\\ncard was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I\\r\\nsaw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps\\r\\neven to you I had better say no more than that it was a name\\r\\nwhich is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,\\r\\nnoblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the\\r\\nhonour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged\\r\\nat once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry\\r\\nquickly through a disagreeable task.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Mr. Holder,\\' said he, \\'I have been informed that you are in the\\r\\nhabit of advancing money.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'The firm does so when the security is good.\\' I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'It is absolutely essential to me,\\' said he, \\'that I should have\\r\\n50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a\\r\\nsum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it\\r\\na matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my\\r\\nposition you can readily understand that it is unwise to place\\r\\none\\'s self under obligations.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\\' I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\\r\\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you\\r\\nthink it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the\\r\\nmoney should be paid at once.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my\\r\\nown private purse,\\' said I, \\'were it not that the strain would be\\r\\nrather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do\\r\\nit in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must\\r\\ninsist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution\\r\\nshould be taken.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I should much prefer to have it so,\\' said he, raising up a\\r\\nsquare, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.\\r\\n\\'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\\'\\r\\nsaid I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Precisely.\\' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,\\r\\nflesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery\\r\\nwhich he had named. \\'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\\' said\\r\\nhe, \\'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The\\r\\nlowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the\\r\\nsum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my\\r\\nsecurity.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some\\r\\nperplexity from it to my illustrious client.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You doubt its value?\\' he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Not at all. I only doubt--\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest\\r\\nabout that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely\\r\\ncertain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a\\r\\npure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ample.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof\\r\\nof the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I\\r\\nhave heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to\\r\\nrefrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to\\r\\npreserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I\\r\\nneed not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any\\r\\nharm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as\\r\\nserious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the\\r\\nworld to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.\\r\\nI leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall\\r\\ncall for it in person on Monday morning.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,\\r\\ncalling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000\\r\\npound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the\\r\\nprecious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not\\r\\nbut think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility\\r\\nwhich it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it\\r\\nwas a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any\\r\\nmisfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever\\r\\nconsented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter\\r\\nthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned\\r\\nonce more to my work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave\\r\\nso precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\\' safes had\\r\\nbeen forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how\\r\\nterrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I\\r\\ndetermined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always\\r\\ncarry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might\\r\\nnever be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a\\r\\ncab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel\\r\\nwith me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs\\r\\nand locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\r\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep\\r\\nout of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three\\r\\nmaid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose\\r\\nabsolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy\\r\\nParr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few\\r\\nmonths. She came with an excellent character, however, and has\\r\\nalways given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has\\r\\nattracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.\\r\\nThat is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we\\r\\nbelieve her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it\\r\\nwill not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an\\r\\nonly son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am\\r\\nmyself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very\\r\\nlikely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I\\r\\nhad to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a\\r\\nmoment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it\\r\\nwould have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I\\r\\nmeant it for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my\\r\\nbusiness, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,\\r\\nwayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the\\r\\nhandling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a\\r\\nmember of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming\\r\\nmanners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long\\r\\npurses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards\\r\\nand to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again\\r\\nto come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\\r\\nallowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried\\r\\nmore than once to break away from the dangerous company which he\\r\\nwas keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir\\r\\nGeorge Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George\\r\\nBurnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently\\r\\nbrought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could\\r\\nhardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than\\r\\nArthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been\\r\\neverywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of\\r\\ngreat personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far\\r\\naway from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his\\r\\ncynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that\\r\\nhe is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,\\r\\ntoo, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\\'s quick insight into\\r\\ncharacter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but\\r\\nwhen my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the\\r\\nworld I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my\\r\\ndaughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,\\r\\na wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and\\r\\ngentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know\\r\\nwhat I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone\\r\\nagainst my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for\\r\\nhe loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I\\r\\nthink that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it\\r\\nwould have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his\\r\\nwhole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and\\r\\nI shall continue with my miserable story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after\\r\\ndinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious\\r\\ntreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name\\r\\nof my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am\\r\\nsure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.\\r\\nMary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous\\r\\ncoronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Where have you put it?\\' asked Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'In my own bureau.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, I hope to goodness the house won\\'t be burgled during the\\r\\nnight.\\' said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'It is locked up,\\' I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I\\r\\nhave opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of\\r\\nwhat he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with\\r\\na very grave face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Look here, dad,\\' said he with his eyes cast down, \\'can you let\\r\\nme have 200 pounds?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No, I cannot!\\' I answered sharply. \\'I have been far too\\r\\ngenerous with you in money matters.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You have been very kind,\\' said he, \\'but I must have this money,\\r\\nor else I can never show my face inside the club again.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And a very good thing, too!\\' I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\\'\\r\\nsaid he. \\'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money\\r\\nin some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try\\r\\nother means.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the\\r\\nmonth. \\'You shall not have a farthing from me,\\' I cried, on which\\r\\nhe bowed and left the room without another word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my\\r\\ntreasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go\\r\\nround the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I\\r\\nusually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform\\r\\nmyself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself\\r\\nat the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as\\r\\nI approached.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tell me, dad,\\' said she, looking, I thought, a little\\r\\ndisturbed, \\'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out\\r\\nto-night?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Certainly not.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she\\r\\nhas only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that\\r\\nit is hardly safe and should be stopped.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer\\r\\nit. Are you sure that everything is fastened?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Quite sure, dad.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Then, good-night.\\' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom\\r\\nagain, where I was soon asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may\\r\\nhave any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question\\r\\nme upon any point which I do not make clear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\\r\\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety\\r\\nin my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.\\r\\nAbout two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in\\r\\nthe house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an\\r\\nimpression behind it as though a window had gently closed\\r\\nsomewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my\\r\\nhorror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in\\r\\nthe next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,\\r\\nand peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Arthur!\\' I screamed, \\'you villain! you thief! How dare you\\r\\ntouch that coronet?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,\\r\\ndressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the\\r\\nlight, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be\\r\\nwrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry\\r\\nhe dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I\\r\\nsnatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with\\r\\nthree of the beryls in it, was missing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You blackguard!\\' I shouted, beside myself with rage. \\'You have\\r\\ndestroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the\\r\\njewels which you have stolen?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Stolen!\\' he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, thief!\\' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\\' said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I\\r\\ncall you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to\\r\\ntear off another piece?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You have called me names enough,\\' said he, \\'I will not stand it\\r\\nany longer. I shall not say another word about this business,\\r\\nsince you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in\\r\\nthe morning and make my own way in the world.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\\' I cried\\r\\nhalf-mad with grief and rage. \\'I shall have this matter probed to\\r\\nthe bottom.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You shall learn nothing from me,\\' said he with a passion such\\r\\nas I should not have thought was in his nature. \\'If you choose to\\r\\ncall the police, let the police find what they can.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my\\r\\nvoice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,\\r\\nat the sight of the coronet and of Arthur\\'s face, she read the\\r\\nwhole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the\\r\\nground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the\\r\\ninvestigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a\\r\\nconstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with\\r\\nhis arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge\\r\\nhim with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\\r\\nmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\\r\\nnational property. I was determined that the law should have its\\r\\nway in everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'At least,\\' said he, \\'you will not have me arrested at once. It\\r\\nwould be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the\\r\\nhouse for five minutes.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you\\r\\nhave stolen,\\' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position\\r\\nin which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only\\r\\nmy honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at\\r\\nstake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would\\r\\nconvulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell\\r\\nme what he had done with the three missing stones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You may as well face the matter,\\' said I; \\'you have been caught\\r\\nin the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.\\r\\nIf you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling\\r\\nus where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\\' he answered,\\r\\nturning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened\\r\\nfor any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for\\r\\nit. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search\\r\\nwas made at once not only of his person but of his room and of\\r\\nevery portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed\\r\\nthe gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the\\r\\nwretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our\\r\\nthreats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after\\r\\ngoing through all the police formalities, have hurried round to\\r\\nyou to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.\\r\\nThe police have openly confessed that they can at present make\\r\\nnothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think\\r\\nnecessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My\\r\\nGod, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son\\r\\nin one night. Oh, what shall I do!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to\\r\\nand fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got\\r\\nbeyond words.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows\\r\\nknitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you receive much company?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of\\r\\nArthur\\'s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No\\r\\none else, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you go out much in society?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is unusual in a young girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She\\r\\nis four-and-twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to\\r\\nher also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Terrible! She is even more affected than I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son\\'s guilt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet\\r\\nin his hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of\\r\\nthe coronet at all injured?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it was twisted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to\\r\\nstraighten it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.\\r\\nBut it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If\\r\\nhis purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?\\r\\nHis silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several\\r\\nsingular points about the case. What did the police think of the\\r\\nnoise which awoke you from your sleep?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur\\'s closing his\\r\\nbedroom door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door\\r\\nso as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the\\r\\ndisappearance of these gems?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture\\r\\nin the hope of finding them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have they thought of looking outside the house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has\\r\\nalready been minutely examined.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, my dear sir,\" said Holmes, \"is it not obvious to you now\\r\\nthat this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you\\r\\nor the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you\\r\\nto be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider\\r\\nwhat is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came\\r\\ndown from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,\\r\\nopened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main\\r\\nforce a small portion of it, went off to some other place,\\r\\nconcealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that\\r\\nnobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six\\r\\ninto the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger\\r\\nof being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what other is there?\" cried the banker with a gesture of\\r\\ndespair. \"If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain\\r\\nthem?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is our task to find that out,\" replied Holmes; \"so now, if\\r\\nyou please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,\\r\\nand devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into\\r\\ndetails.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,\\r\\nwhich I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy\\r\\nwere deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I\\r\\nconfess that the guilt of the banker\\'s son appeared to me to be\\r\\nas obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such\\r\\nfaith in Holmes\\' judgment that I felt that there must be some\\r\\ngrounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted\\r\\nexplanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the\\r\\nsouthern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his\\r\\nhat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client\\r\\nappeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope\\r\\nwhich had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\\r\\ndesultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\\r\\njourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest\\r\\nresidence of the great financier.\\r\\n\\r\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing\\r\\nback a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a\\r\\nsnow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates\\r\\nwhich closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden\\r\\nthicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges\\r\\nstretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the\\r\\ntradesmen\\'s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the\\r\\nstables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a\\r\\npublic, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing\\r\\nat the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\\r\\nfront, down the tradesmen\\'s path, and so round by the garden\\r\\nbehind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I\\r\\nwent into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should\\r\\nreturn. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and\\r\\na young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,\\r\\nslim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against\\r\\nthe absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever\\r\\nseen such deadly paleness in a woman\\'s face. Her lips, too, were\\r\\nbloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept\\r\\nsilently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of\\r\\ngrief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\\r\\nmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong\\r\\ncharacter, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding\\r\\nmy presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand\\r\\nover his head with a sweet womanly caress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you\\r\\nnot, dad?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman\\'s\\r\\ninstincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will\\r\\nbe sorry for having acted so harshly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should\\r\\nsuspect him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with\\r\\nthe coronet in his hand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take\\r\\nmy word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say\\r\\nno more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in\\r\\nprison!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!\\r\\nYour affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences\\r\\nto me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman\\r\\ndown from London to inquire more deeply into it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This gentleman?\" she asked, facing round to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in\\r\\nthe stable lane now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The stable lane?\" She raised her dark eyebrows. \"What can he\\r\\nhope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,\\r\\nthat you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,\\r\\nthat my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may\\r\\nprove it,\" returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the\\r\\nsnow from his shoes. \"I believe I have the honour of addressing\\r\\nMiss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You heard nothing yourself last night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard\\r\\nthat, and I came down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you\\r\\nfasten all the windows?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were they all fastened this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked\\r\\nto your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and\\r\\nwho may have heard uncle\\'s remarks about the coronet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her\\r\\nsweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what is the good of all these vague theories,\" cried the\\r\\nbanker impatiently, \"when I have told you that I saw Arthur with\\r\\nthe coronet in his hands?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this\\r\\ngirl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I\\r\\npresume?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I\\r\\nmet her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.\\r\\nHis name is Francis Prosper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He stood,\" said Holmes, \"to the left of the door--that is to\\r\\nsay, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he is a man with a wooden leg?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\\'s expressive\\r\\nblack eyes. \"Why, you are like a magician,\" said she. \"How do you\\r\\nknow that?\" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in\\r\\nHolmes\\' thin, eager face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be very glad now to go upstairs,\" said he. \"I shall\\r\\nprobably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps\\r\\nI had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at\\r\\nthe large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.\\r\\nThis he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill\\r\\nwith his powerful magnifying lens. \"Now we shall go upstairs,\"\\r\\nsaid he at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banker\\'s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little\\r\\nchamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.\\r\\nHolmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which key was used to open it?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the\\r\\nlumber-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you it here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is it on the dressing-table.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a noiseless lock,\" said he. \"It is no wonder that it did\\r\\nnot wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must\\r\\nhave a look at it.\" He opened the case, and taking out the diadem\\r\\nhe laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the\\r\\njeweller\\'s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I\\r\\nhave ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,\\r\\nwhere a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Mr. Holder,\" said Holmes, \"here is the corner which\\r\\ncorresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I\\r\\nbeg that you will break it off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \"I should not dream of trying,\"\\r\\nsaid he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I will.\" Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but\\r\\nwithout result. \"I feel it give a little,\" said he; \"but, though\\r\\nI am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my\\r\\ntime to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do\\r\\nyou think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would\\r\\nbe a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this\\r\\nhappened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard\\r\\nnothing of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,\\r\\nMiss Holder?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess that I still share my uncle\\'s perplexity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary\\r\\nluck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault\\r\\nif we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your\\r\\npermission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations\\r\\noutside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\\r\\nunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an\\r\\nhour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet\\r\\nheavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.\\r\\nHolder,\" said he; \"I can serve you best by returning to my\\r\\nrooms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot tell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banker wrung his hands. \"I shall never see them again!\" he\\r\\ncried. \"And my son? You give me hopes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My opinion is in no way altered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, for God\\'s sake, what was this dark business which was\\r\\nacted in my house last night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow\\r\\nmorning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to\\r\\nmake it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to\\r\\nact for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you\\r\\nplace no limit on the sum I may draw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would give my fortune to have them back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.\\r\\nGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here\\r\\nagain before evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\\'s mind was now made up\\r\\nabout the case, although what his conclusions were was more than\\r\\nI could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward\\r\\njourney I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always\\r\\nglided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in\\r\\ndespair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our\\r\\nrooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in\\r\\na few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned\\r\\nup, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he\\r\\nwas a perfect sample of the class.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that this should do,\" said he, glancing into the glass\\r\\nabove the fireplace. \"I only wish that you could come with me,\\r\\nWatson, but I fear that it won\\'t do. I may be on the trail in\\r\\nthis matter, or I may be following a will-o\\'-the-wisp, but I\\r\\nshall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few\\r\\nhours.\" He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,\\r\\nsandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this\\r\\nrude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in\\r\\nexcellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his\\r\\nhand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a\\r\\ncup of tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only looked in as I passed,\" said he. \"I am going right on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time\\r\\nbefore I get back. Don\\'t wait up for me in case I should be\\r\\nlate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How are you getting on?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham\\r\\nsince I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a\\r\\nvery sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a\\r\\ngood deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get\\r\\nthese disreputable clothes off and return to my highly\\r\\nrespectable self.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for\\r\\nsatisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,\\r\\nand there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He\\r\\nhastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of\\r\\nthe hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his\\r\\ncongenial hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so\\r\\nI retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away\\r\\nfor days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that\\r\\nhis lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he\\r\\ncame in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there\\r\\nhe was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the\\r\\nother, as fresh and trim as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\" said he, \"but\\r\\nyou remember that our client has rather an early appointment this\\r\\nmorning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, it is after nine now,\" I answered. \"I should not be\\r\\nsurprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the\\r\\nchange which had come over him, for his face which was naturally\\r\\nof a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,\\r\\nwhile his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered\\r\\nwith a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than\\r\\nhis violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into\\r\\nthe armchair which I pushed forward for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\" said\\r\\nhe. \"Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without\\r\\na care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured\\r\\nage. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,\\r\\nMary, has deserted me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Deserted you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was\\r\\nempty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to\\r\\nher last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had\\r\\nmarried my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was\\r\\nthoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers\\r\\nin this note:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,\\r\\nand that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune\\r\\nmight never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my\\r\\nmind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must\\r\\nleave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is\\r\\nprovided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will\\r\\nbe fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in\\r\\ndeath, I am ever your loving,--MARY.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it\\r\\npoints to suicide?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible\\r\\nsolution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of\\r\\nyour troubles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have\\r\\nlearned something! Where are the gems?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for\\r\\nthem?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would pay ten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.\\r\\nAnd there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?\\r\\nHere is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes\\r\\nwalked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of\\r\\ngold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have it!\" he gasped. \"I am saved! I am saved!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and\\r\\nhe hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\" said Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes rather sternly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Owe!\" He caught up a pen. \"Name the sum, and I will pay it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that\\r\\nnoble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I\\r\\nshould be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to\\r\\nhave one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it was not Arthur who took them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him\\r\\nknow that the truth is known.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an\\r\\ninterview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the\\r\\nstory, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was\\r\\nright and to add the very few details which were not yet quite\\r\\nclear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his\\r\\nlips.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary\\r\\nmystery!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached\\r\\nit. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me\\r\\nto say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding\\r\\nbetween Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now\\r\\nfled together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My Mary? Impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither\\r\\nyou nor your son knew the true character of this man when you\\r\\nadmitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most\\r\\ndangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely\\r\\ndesperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece\\r\\nknew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he\\r\\nhad done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she\\r\\nalone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,\\r\\nbut at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing\\r\\nhim nearly every evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!\" cried the banker with an\\r\\nashen face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.\\r\\nYour niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,\\r\\nslipped down and talked to her lover through the window which\\r\\nleads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right\\r\\nthrough the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the\\r\\ncoronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he\\r\\nbent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but\\r\\nthere are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all\\r\\nother loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had\\r\\nhardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\r\\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you\\r\\nabout one of the servants\\' escapade with her wooden-legged lover,\\r\\nwhich was all perfectly true.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but\\r\\nhe slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.\\r\\nIn the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,\\r\\nso he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin\\r\\nwalking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared\\r\\ninto your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad\\r\\nslipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what\\r\\nwould come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the\\r\\nroom again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw\\r\\nthat she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed\\r\\ndown the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and\\r\\nslipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see\\r\\nwhat passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the\\r\\nwindow, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then\\r\\nclosing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close\\r\\nto where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action\\r\\nwithout a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the\\r\\ninstant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune\\r\\nthis would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it\\r\\nright. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened\\r\\nthe window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,\\r\\nwhere he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George\\r\\nBurnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was\\r\\na struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the\\r\\ncoronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son\\r\\nstruck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\\r\\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet\\r\\nin his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your\\r\\nroom, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in\\r\\nthe struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you\\r\\nappeared upon the scene.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it possible?\" gasped the banker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when\\r\\nhe felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not\\r\\nexplain the true state of affairs without betraying one who\\r\\ncertainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He\\r\\ntook the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her\\r\\nsecret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the\\r\\ncoronet,\" cried Mr. Holder. \"Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have\\r\\nbeen! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!\\r\\nThe dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the\\r\\nscene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I arrived at the house,\" continued Holmes, \"I at once went\\r\\nvery carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in\\r\\nthe snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since\\r\\nthe evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost\\r\\nto preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen\\'s path, but\\r\\nfound it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,\\r\\nhowever, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood\\r\\nand talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed\\r\\nthat he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been\\r\\ndisturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was\\r\\nshown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had\\r\\nwaited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time\\r\\nthat this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had\\r\\nalready spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed\\r\\nround the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,\\r\\nwhich I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\\r\\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in\\r\\nfront of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second\\r\\ndouble line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked\\r\\nfeet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the\\r\\nlatter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the\\r\\nother had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over\\r\\nthe depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed\\r\\nafter the other. I followed them up and found they led to the\\r\\nhall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while\\r\\nwaiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred\\r\\nyards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,\\r\\nwhere the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,\\r\\nand, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me\\r\\nthat I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and\\r\\nanother little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been\\r\\nhurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that\\r\\nthe pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the\\r\\nsill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could\\r\\nat once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the\\r\\noutline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming\\r\\nin. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what\\r\\nhad occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had\\r\\nbrought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had\\r\\npursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged\\r\\nat the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which\\r\\nneither alone could have effected. He had returned with the\\r\\nprize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So\\r\\nfar I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who\\r\\nwas it brought him the coronet?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the\\r\\nimpossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the\\r\\ntruth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,\\r\\nso there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were\\r\\nthe maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in\\r\\ntheir place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his\\r\\ncousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should\\r\\nretain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful\\r\\none. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and\\r\\nhow she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture\\r\\nbecame a certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,\\r\\nfor who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must\\r\\nfeel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your\\r\\ncircle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir\\r\\nGeorge Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil\\r\\nreputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots\\r\\nand retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur\\r\\nhad discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was\\r\\nsafe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his\\r\\nown family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took\\r\\nnext. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\\'s house,\\r\\nmanaged to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that\\r\\nhis master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at\\r\\nthe expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of\\r\\nhis cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and\\r\\nsaw that they exactly fitted the tracks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Holder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home\\r\\nand changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to\\r\\nplay then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert\\r\\nscandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our\\r\\nhands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of\\r\\ncourse, he denied everything. But when I gave him every\\r\\nparticular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a\\r\\nlife-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I\\r\\nclapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he\\r\\nbecame a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give\\r\\nhim a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That\\r\\nbrought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. \\'Why,\\r\\ndash it all!\\' said he, \\'I\\'ve let them go at six hundred for the\\r\\nthree!\\' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had\\r\\nthem, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I\\r\\nset to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000\\r\\npounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all\\r\\nwas right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\\'clock, after\\r\\nwhat I may call a really hard day\\'s work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\" said\\r\\nthe banker, rising. \"Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but\\r\\nyou shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your\\r\\nskill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I\\r\\nmust fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I\\r\\nhave done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my\\r\\nvery heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that we may safely say,\" returned Holmes, \"that she is\\r\\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that\\r\\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than\\r\\nsufficient punishment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the man who loves art for its own sake,\" remarked Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily\\r\\nTelegraph, \"it is frequently in its least important and lowliest\\r\\nmanifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is\\r\\npleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped\\r\\nthis truth that in these little records of our cases which you\\r\\nhave been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,\\r\\noccasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much\\r\\nto the many causes c\\xe9l\\xe8bres and sensational trials in which I\\r\\nhave figured but rather to those incidents which may have been\\r\\ntrivial in themselves, but which have given room for those\\r\\nfaculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made\\r\\nmy special province.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet,\" said I, smiling, \"I cannot quite hold myself absolved\\r\\nfrom the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my\\r\\nrecords.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have erred, perhaps,\" he observed, taking up a glowing\\r\\ncinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood\\r\\npipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a\\r\\ndisputatious rather than a meditative mood--\"you have erred\\r\\nperhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your\\r\\nstatements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing\\r\\nupon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is\\r\\nreally the only notable feature about the thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\"\\r\\nI remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism\\r\\nwhich I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my\\r\\nfriend\\'s singular character.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it is not selfishness or conceit,\" said he, answering, as\\r\\nwas his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. \"If I claim full\\r\\njustice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a\\r\\nthing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it\\r\\nis upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should\\r\\ndwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of\\r\\nlectures into a series of tales.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after\\r\\nbreakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at\\r\\nBaker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of\\r\\ndun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,\\r\\nshapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit\\r\\nand shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for\\r\\nthe table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been\\r\\nsilent all the morning, dipping continuously into the\\r\\nadvertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,\\r\\nhaving apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very\\r\\nsweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the same time,\" he remarked after a pause, during which he\\r\\nhad sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,\\r\\n\"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of\\r\\nthese cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself\\r\\nin, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,\\r\\nat all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King\\r\\nof Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the\\r\\nproblem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the\\r\\nincident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are\\r\\noutside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I\\r\\nfear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The end may have been so,\" I answered, \"but the methods I hold\\r\\nto have been novel and of interest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant\\r\\npublic, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a\\r\\ncompositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of\\r\\nanalysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot\\r\\nblame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at\\r\\nleast criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As\\r\\nto my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an\\r\\nagency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to\\r\\nyoung ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched\\r\\nbottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my\\r\\nzero-point, I fancy. Read it!\" He tossed a crumpled letter across\\r\\nto me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and\\r\\nran thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether\\r\\nI should or should not accept a situation which has been offered\\r\\nto me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I\\r\\ndo not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\\r\\n                                               \"VIOLET HUNTER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know the young lady?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is half-past ten now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You\\r\\nremember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to\\r\\nbe a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.\\r\\nIt may be so in this case, also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved,\\r\\nfor here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.\\r\\nShe was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,\\r\\nfreckled like a plover\\'s egg, and with the brisk manner of a\\r\\nwoman who has had her own way to make in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\" said she, as my\\r\\ncompanion rose to greet her, \"but I have had a very strange\\r\\nexperience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort\\r\\nfrom whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be\\r\\nkind enough to tell me what I should do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything\\r\\nthat I can to serve you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner\\r\\nand speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching\\r\\nfashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and\\r\\nhis finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been a governess for five years,\" said she, \"in the\\r\\nfamily of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel\\r\\nreceived an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his\\r\\nchildren over to America with him, so that I found myself without\\r\\na situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but\\r\\nwithout success. At last the little money which I had saved began\\r\\nto run short, and I was at my wit\\'s end as to what I should do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End\\r\\ncalled Westaway\\'s, and there I used to call about once a week in\\r\\norder to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.\\r\\nWestaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is\\r\\nreally managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,\\r\\nand the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom,\\r\\nand are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers\\r\\nand sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office\\r\\nas usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A\\r\\nprodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy\\r\\nchin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at\\r\\nher elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very\\r\\nearnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a\\r\\njump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'That will do,\\' said he; \\'I could not ask for anything better.\\r\\nCapital! capital!\\' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his\\r\\nhands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a\\r\\ncomfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You are looking for a situation, miss?\\' he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, sir.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'As governess?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Yes, sir.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And what salary do you ask?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence\\r\\nMunro.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!\\' he cried, throwing his\\r\\nfat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling\\r\\npassion. \\'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with\\r\\nsuch attractions and accomplishments?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\\' said I.\\r\\n\\'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tut, tut!\\' he cried. \\'This is all quite beside the question.\\r\\nThe point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment\\r\\nof a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are\\r\\nnot fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a\\r\\nconsiderable part in the history of the country. But if you have\\r\\nwhy, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to\\r\\naccept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,\\r\\nmadam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,\\r\\nsuch an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,\\r\\nhowever, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,\\r\\nopened a pocket-book and took out a note.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'It is also my custom,\\' said he, smiling in the most pleasant\\r\\nfashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid\\r\\nthe white creases of his face, \\'to advance to my young ladies\\r\\nhalf their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little\\r\\nexpenses of their journey and their wardrobe.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so\\r\\nthoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the\\r\\nadvance was a great convenience, and yet there was something\\r\\nunnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know\\r\\na little more before I quite committed myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'May I ask where you live, sir?\\' said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles\\r\\non the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my\\r\\ndear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would\\r\\nbe.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if\\r\\nyou could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack!\\r\\nsmack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!\\' He leaned back\\r\\nin his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was a little startled at the nature of the child\\'s amusement,\\r\\nbut the father\\'s laughter made me think that perhaps he was\\r\\njoking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'My sole duties, then,\\' I asked, \\'are to take charge of a single\\r\\nchild?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\\' he\\r\\ncried. \\'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would\\r\\nsuggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided\\r\\nalways that they were such commands as a lady might with\\r\\npropriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I should be happy to make myself useful.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you\\r\\nknow--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress\\r\\nwhich we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.\\r\\nHeh?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No,\\' said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to\\r\\nyou?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, no.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nmy hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of\\r\\nchestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of\\r\\nsacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\\' said I. He had been\\r\\nwatching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a\\r\\nshadow pass over his face as I spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I am afraid that it is quite essential,\\' said he. \\'It is a\\r\\nlittle fancy of my wife\\'s, and ladies\\' fancies, you know, madam,\\r\\nladies\\' fancies must be consulted. And so you won\\'t cut your\\r\\nhair?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No, sir, I really could not,\\' I answered firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a\\r\\npity, because in other respects you would really have done very\\r\\nnicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more\\r\\nof your young ladies.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers\\r\\nwithout a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so\\r\\nmuch annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting\\r\\nthat she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\\' she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'If you please, Miss Stoper.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the\\r\\nmost excellent offers in this fashion,\\' said she sharply. \\'You\\r\\ncan hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such\\r\\nopening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.\\' She struck a gong\\r\\nupon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found\\r\\nlittle enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the\\r\\ntable, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very\\r\\nfoolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and\\r\\nexpected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were\\r\\nat least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few\\r\\ngovernesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides,\\r\\nwhat use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing\\r\\nit short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was\\r\\ninclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after\\r\\nI was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go\\r\\nback to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open\\r\\nwhen I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it\\r\\nhere and I will read it to you:\\r\\n\\r\\n                       \"\\'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\r\\n\"\\'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\r\\naddress, and I write from here to ask you whether you have\\r\\nreconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you\\r\\nshould come, for she has been much attracted by my description of\\r\\nyou. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a\\r\\nyear, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which\\r\\nour fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My\\r\\nwife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would\\r\\nlike you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need\\r\\nnot, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one\\r\\nbelonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which\\r\\nwould, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting\\r\\nhere or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that\\r\\nneed cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no\\r\\ndoubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty\\r\\nduring our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain\\r\\nfirm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary\\r\\nmay recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child\\r\\nis concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall\\r\\nmeet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.\\r\\nYours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and\\r\\nmy mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,\\r\\nthat before taking the final step I should like to submit the\\r\\nwhole matter to your consideration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\\r\\nquestion,\" said Holmes, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you would not advise me to refuse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to\\r\\nsee a sister of mine apply for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself\\r\\nformed some opinion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.\\r\\nRucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not\\r\\npossible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the\\r\\nmatter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that\\r\\nhe humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an\\r\\noutbreak?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is\\r\\nthe most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a\\r\\nnice household for a young lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what\\r\\nmakes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when\\r\\nthey could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some\\r\\nstrong reason behind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would\\r\\nunderstand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so\\r\\nmuch stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that\\r\\nyour little problem promises to be the most interesting which has\\r\\ncome my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel\\r\\nabout some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt\\r\\nor in danger--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Danger! What danger do you foresee?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \"It would cease to be a danger if\\r\\nwe could define it,\" said he. \"But at any time, day or night, a\\r\\ntelegram would bring me down to your help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is enough.\" She rose briskly from her chair with the\\r\\nanxiety all swept from her face. \"I shall go down to Hampshire\\r\\nquite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,\\r\\nsacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester\\r\\nto-morrow.\" With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both\\r\\ngood-night and bustled off upon her way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At least,\" said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending\\r\\nthe stairs, \"she seems to be a young lady who is very well able\\r\\nto take care of herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And she would need to be,\" said Holmes gravely. \"I am much\\r\\nmistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not very long before my friend\\'s prediction was fulfilled.\\r\\nA fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts\\r\\nturning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of\\r\\nhuman experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual\\r\\nsalary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to\\r\\nsomething abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether\\r\\nthe man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond\\r\\nmy powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat\\r\\nfrequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an\\r\\nabstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his\\r\\nhand when I mentioned it. \"Data! data! data!\" he cried\\r\\nimpatiently. \"I can\\'t make bricks without clay.\" And yet he would\\r\\nalways wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever\\r\\nhave accepted such a situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night\\r\\njust as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down\\r\\nto one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently\\r\\nindulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a\\r\\ntest-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came\\r\\ndown to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,\\r\\nand then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,\" said he, and turned back\\r\\nto his chemical studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday\\r\\nto-morrow,\" it said. \"Do come! I am at my wit\\'s end.  HUNTER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you come with me?\" asked Holmes, glancing up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should wish to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just look it up, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a train at half-past nine,\" said I, glancing over my\\r\\nBradshaw. \"It is due at Winchester at 11:30.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my\\r\\nanalysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the\\r\\nmorning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy eleven o\\'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the\\r\\nold English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers\\r\\nall the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he\\r\\nthrew them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal\\r\\nspring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white\\r\\nclouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining\\r\\nvery brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,\\r\\nwhich set an edge to a man\\'s energy. All over the countryside,\\r\\naway to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and\\r\\ngrey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light\\r\\ngreen of the new foliage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are they not fresh and beautiful?\" I cried with all the\\r\\nenthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, Watson,\" said he, \"that it is one of the curses of\\r\\na mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with\\r\\nreference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered\\r\\nhouses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,\\r\\nand the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their\\r\\nisolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried. \"Who would associate crime with these\\r\\ndear old homesteads?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,\\r\\nWatson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest\\r\\nalleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin\\r\\nthan does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You horrify me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion\\r\\ncan do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no\\r\\nlane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of\\r\\na drunkard\\'s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among\\r\\nthe neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever\\r\\nso close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is\\r\\nbut a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these\\r\\nlonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part\\r\\nwith poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the\\r\\ndeeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,\\r\\nyear in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this\\r\\nlady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I\\r\\nshould never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of\\r\\ncountry which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is\\r\\nnot personally threatened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. She has her freedom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would\\r\\ncover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is\\r\\ncorrect can only be determined by the fresh information which we\\r\\nshall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of\\r\\nthe cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has\\r\\nto tell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no\\r\\ndistance from the station, and there we found the young lady\\r\\nwaiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch\\r\\nawaited us upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am so delighted that you have come,\" she said earnestly. \"It\\r\\nis so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I\\r\\nshould do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray tell us what has happened to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.\\r\\nRucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into\\r\\ntown this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us have everything in its due order.\" Holmes thrust his long\\r\\nthin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,\\r\\nwith no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is\\r\\nonly fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and\\r\\nI am not easy in my mind about them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can you not understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just\\r\\nas it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and\\r\\ndrove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he\\r\\nsaid, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,\\r\\nfor it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all\\r\\nstained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds\\r\\nround it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which\\r\\nslopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about\\r\\na hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs\\r\\nto the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord\\r\\nSoutherton\\'s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in\\r\\nfront of the hall door has given its name to the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,\\r\\nand was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.\\r\\nThere was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to\\r\\nus to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is\\r\\nnot mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much\\r\\nyounger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,\\r\\nwhile he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their\\r\\nconversation I have gathered that they have been married about\\r\\nseven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by\\r\\nthe first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.\\r\\nRucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them\\r\\nwas that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As\\r\\nthe daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite\\r\\nimagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her\\r\\nfather\\'s young wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as\\r\\nin feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.\\r\\nShe was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately\\r\\ndevoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey\\r\\neyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every\\r\\nlittle want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her\\r\\nalso in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they\\r\\nseemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,\\r\\nthis woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the\\r\\nsaddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her\\r\\nin tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of\\r\\nher child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so\\r\\nutterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small\\r\\nfor his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.\\r\\nHis whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between\\r\\nsavage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving\\r\\npain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea\\r\\nof amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning\\r\\nthe capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would\\r\\nrather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he\\r\\nhas little to do with my story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad of all details,\" remarked my friend, \"whether they\\r\\nseem to you to be relevant or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one\\r\\nunpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was\\r\\nthe appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a\\r\\nman and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,\\r\\nuncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual\\r\\nsmell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been\\r\\nquite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.\\r\\nHis wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as\\r\\nsilent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most\\r\\nunpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\\r\\nnursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one\\r\\ncorner of the building.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was\\r\\nvery quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after\\r\\nbreakfast and whispered something to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, yes,\\' said he, turning to me, \\'we are very much obliged to\\r\\nyou, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut\\r\\nyour hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest\\r\\niota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue\\r\\ndress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in\\r\\nyour room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should\\r\\nboth be extremely obliged.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade\\r\\nof blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it\\r\\nbore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not\\r\\nhave been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which\\r\\nseemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for\\r\\nme in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching\\r\\nalong the entire front of the house, with three long windows\\r\\nreaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the\\r\\ncentral window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was\\r\\nasked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the\\r\\nother side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\\r\\nstories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how\\r\\ncomical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs.\\r\\nRucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so\\r\\nmuch as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,\\r\\nanxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle\\r\\nsuddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the\\r\\nday, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in\\r\\nthe nursery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two days later this same performance was gone through under\\r\\nexactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I\\r\\nsat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny\\r\\nstories of which my employer had an immense r\\xe9pertoire, and which\\r\\nhe told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and\\r\\nmoving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not\\r\\nfall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for\\r\\nabout ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then\\r\\nsuddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and\\r\\nto change my dress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to\\r\\nwhat the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly\\r\\nbe. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face\\r\\naway from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire\\r\\nto see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be\\r\\nimpossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been\\r\\nbroken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of\\r\\nthe glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst\\r\\nof my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able\\r\\nwith a little management to see all that there was behind me. I\\r\\nconfess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that\\r\\nwas my first impression. At the second glance, however, I\\r\\nperceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,\\r\\na small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in\\r\\nmy direction. The road is an important highway, and there are\\r\\nusually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the\\r\\nrailings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I\\r\\nlowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her\\r\\neyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,\\r\\nbut I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my\\r\\nhand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Jephro,\\' said she, \\'there is an impertinent fellow upon the\\r\\nroad there who stares up at Miss Hunter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\\' he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No, I know no one in these parts.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to\\r\\nhim to go away.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Surely it would be better to take no notice.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn\\r\\nround and wave him away like that.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew\\r\\ndown the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have\\r\\nnot sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor\\r\\nseen the man in the road.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray continue,\" said Holmes. \"Your narrative promises to be a\\r\\nmost interesting one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may\\r\\nprove to be little relation between the different incidents of\\r\\nwhich I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper\\r\\nBeeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands\\r\\nnear the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp\\r\\nrattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving\\r\\nabout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Look in here!\\' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\\r\\nplanks. \\'Is he not a beauty?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a\\r\\nvague figure huddled up in the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Don\\'t be frightened,\\' said my employer, laughing at the start\\r\\nwhich I had given. \\'It\\'s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,\\r\\nbut really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do\\r\\nanything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,\\r\\nso that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose\\r\\nevery night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs\\r\\nupon. For goodness\\' sake don\\'t you ever on any pretext set your\\r\\nfoot over the threshold at night, for it\\'s as much as your life\\r\\nis worth.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to\\r\\nlook out of my bedroom window about two o\\'clock in the morning.\\r\\nIt was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the\\r\\nhouse was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was\\r\\nstanding, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was\\r\\naware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper\\r\\nbeeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It\\r\\nwas a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging\\r\\njowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly\\r\\nacross the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.\\r\\nThat dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not\\r\\nthink that any burglar could have done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as\\r\\nyou know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a\\r\\ngreat coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the\\r\\nchild was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the\\r\\nfurniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.\\r\\nThere was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones\\r\\nempty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two\\r\\nwith my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was\\r\\nnaturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It\\r\\nstruck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,\\r\\nso I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very\\r\\nfirst key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There\\r\\nwas only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never\\r\\nguess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,\\r\\nand the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing\\r\\nobtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in\\r\\nthe drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the\\r\\ncontents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two\\r\\ntresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was\\r\\nit not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at\\r\\nall of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,\\r\\nand I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that\\r\\nI had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had\\r\\nlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nand I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.\\r\\nThere was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited\\r\\nat all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of\\r\\nthe Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.\\r\\nOne day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle\\r\\ncoming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on\\r\\nhis face which made him a very different person to the round,\\r\\njovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his\\r\\nbrow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his\\r\\ntemples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me\\r\\nwithout a word or a look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the\\r\\ngrounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I\\r\\ncould see the windows of this part of the house. There were four\\r\\nof them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the\\r\\nfourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I\\r\\nstrolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle\\r\\ncame out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ah!\\' said he, \\'you must not think me rude if I passed you\\r\\nwithout a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with\\r\\nbusiness matters.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assured him that I was not offended. \\'By the way,\\' said I,\\r\\n\\'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one\\r\\nof them has the shutters up.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled\\r\\nat my remark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Photography is one of my hobbies,\\' said he. \\'I have made my\\r\\ndark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we\\r\\nhave come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever\\r\\nbelieved it?\\' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest\\r\\nin his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and\\r\\nannoyance, but no jest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there\\r\\nwas something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,\\r\\nI was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,\\r\\nthough I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a\\r\\nfeeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this\\r\\nplace. They talk of woman\\'s instinct; perhaps it was woman\\'s\\r\\ninstinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\\r\\nand I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the\\r\\nforbidden door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\\r\\nbesides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to\\r\\ndo in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large\\r\\nblack linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been\\r\\ndrinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when\\r\\nI came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at\\r\\nall that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both\\r\\ndownstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an\\r\\nadmirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,\\r\\nopened the door, and slipped through.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and\\r\\nuncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.\\r\\nRound this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third\\r\\nof which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and\\r\\ncheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so\\r\\nthick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through\\r\\nthem. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it\\r\\nhad been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked\\r\\nat one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with\\r\\nstout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was\\r\\nnot there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\\r\\nshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\\r\\nbeneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was\\r\\na skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the\\r\\npassage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it\\r\\nmight veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room\\r\\nand saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little\\r\\nslit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,\\r\\nunreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My\\r\\noverstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran\\r\\nas though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the\\r\\nskirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,\\r\\nand straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'So,\\' said he, smiling, \\'it was you, then. I thought that it\\r\\nmust be when I saw the door open.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Oh, I am so frightened!\\' I panted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\\'--you cannot think how\\r\\ncaressing and soothing his manner was--\\'and what has frightened\\r\\nyou, my dear young lady?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I\\r\\nwas keenly on my guard against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\\' I answered.\\r\\n\\'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was\\r\\nfrightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in\\r\\nthere!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Only that?\\' said he, looking at me keenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why, what did you think?\\' I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why do you think that I lock this door?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I am sure that I do not know.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you\\r\\nsee?\\' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I am sure if I had known--\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over\\r\\nthat threshold again\\'--here in an instant the smile hardened into\\r\\na grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a\\r\\ndemon--\\'I\\'ll throw you to the mastiff.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that\\r\\nI must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing\\r\\nuntil I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I\\r\\nthought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without\\r\\nsome advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the\\r\\nwoman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible\\r\\nto me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of\\r\\ncourse I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was\\r\\nalmost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would\\r\\nsend you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the\\r\\noffice, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\\r\\nreturned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my\\r\\nmind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I\\r\\nremembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of\\r\\ninsensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one\\r\\nin the household who had any influence with the savage creature,\\r\\nor who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and\\r\\nlay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.\\r\\nI had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this\\r\\nmorning, but I must be back before three o\\'clock, for Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the\\r\\nevening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\\r\\nall my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you\\r\\ncould tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should\\r\\ndo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.\\r\\nMy friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in\\r\\nhis pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon\\r\\nhis face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Toller still drunk?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do\\r\\nnothing with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, the wine-cellar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very\\r\\nbrave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could\\r\\nperform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not\\r\\nthink you a quite exceptional woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will try. What is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\\'clock, my friend\\r\\nand I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,\\r\\nwe hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might\\r\\ngive the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some\\r\\nerrand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate\\r\\nmatters immensely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of\\r\\ncourse there is only one feasible explanation. You have been\\r\\nbrought there to personate someone, and the real person is\\r\\nimprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this\\r\\nprisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice\\r\\nRucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to\\r\\nAmerica. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,\\r\\nfigure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very\\r\\npossibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\\r\\ncourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you\\r\\ncame upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some\\r\\nfriend of hers--possibly her fianc\\xe9--and no doubt, as you wore\\r\\nthe girl\\'s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your\\r\\nlaughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,\\r\\nthat Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer\\r\\ndesired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent\\r\\nhim from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly\\r\\nclear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of\\r\\nthe child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What on earth has that to do with it?\" I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining\\r\\nlight as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the\\r\\nparents. Don\\'t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have\\r\\nfrequently gained my first real insight into the character of\\r\\nparents by studying their children. This child\\'s disposition is\\r\\nabnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\\'s sake, and whether he\\r\\nderives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or\\r\\nfrom his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their\\r\\npower.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\" cried our client. \"A\\r\\nthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you\\r\\nhave hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to\\r\\nthis poor creature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning\\r\\nman. We can do nothing until seven o\\'clock. At that hour we shall\\r\\nbe with you, and it will not be long before we solve the\\r\\nmystery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we\\r\\nreached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside\\r\\npublic-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining\\r\\nlike burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were\\r\\nsufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been\\r\\nstanding smiling on the door-step.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you managed it?\" asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \"That is\\r\\nMrs. Toller in the cellar,\" said she. \"Her husband lies snoring\\r\\non the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates\\r\\nof Mr. Rucastle\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have done well indeed!\" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \"Now\\r\\nlead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a\\r\\npassage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss\\r\\nHunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the\\r\\ntransverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but\\r\\nwithout success. No sound came from within, and at the silence\\r\\nHolmes\\' face clouded over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I trust that we are not too late,\" said he. \"I think, Miss\\r\\nHunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put\\r\\nyour shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our\\r\\nway in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united\\r\\nstrength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There\\r\\nwas no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a\\r\\nbasketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner\\r\\ngone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There has been some villainy here,\" said Holmes; \"this beauty\\r\\nhas guessed Miss Hunter\\'s intentions and has carried his victim\\r\\noff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\" He\\r\\nswung himself up onto the roof. \"Ah, yes,\" he cried, \"here\\'s the\\r\\nend of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is impossible,\" said Miss Hunter; \"the ladder was not\\r\\nthere when the Rucastles went away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\\r\\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were\\r\\nhe whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it\\r\\nwould be as well for you to have your pistol ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at\\r\\nthe door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy\\r\\nstick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the\\r\\nwall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and\\r\\nconfronted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You villain!\" said he, \"where\\'s your daughter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open\\r\\nskylight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is for me to ask you that,\" he shrieked, \"you thieves! Spies\\r\\nand thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\\'ll\\r\\nserve you!\" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he\\r\\ncould go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s gone for the dog!\" cried Miss Hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have my revolver,\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better close the front door,\" cried Holmes, and we all rushed\\r\\ndown the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we\\r\\nheard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a\\r\\nhorrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An\\r\\nelderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out\\r\\nat a side door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My God!\" he cried. \"Someone has loosed the dog. It\\'s not been\\r\\nfed for two days. Quick, quick, or it\\'ll be too late!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with\\r\\nToller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its\\r\\nblack muzzle buried in Rucastle\\'s throat, while he writhed and\\r\\nscreamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and\\r\\nit fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great\\r\\ncreases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and\\r\\ncarried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid\\r\\nhim upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered\\r\\nToller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to\\r\\nrelieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door\\r\\nopened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Toller!\" cried Miss Hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he\\r\\nwent up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\\'t let me know\\r\\nwhat you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains\\r\\nwere wasted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha!\" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \"It is clear that Mrs.\\r\\nToller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several\\r\\npoints on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will soon make it clear to you,\" said she; \"and I\\'d have done\\r\\nso before now if I could ha\\' got out from the cellar. If there\\'s\\r\\npolice-court business over this, you\\'ll remember that I was the\\r\\none that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\\'s friend\\r\\ntoo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\\'t, from the time\\r\\nthat her father married again. She was slighted like and had no\\r\\nsay in anything, but it never really became bad for her until\\r\\nafter she met Mr. Fowler at a friend\\'s house. As well as I could\\r\\nlearn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so\\r\\nquiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them\\r\\nbut just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\\'s hands. He knew he was\\r\\nsafe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming\\r\\nforward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then\\r\\nher father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to\\r\\nsign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use\\r\\nher money. When she wouldn\\'t do it, he kept on worrying her until\\r\\nshe got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\\'s door. Then\\r\\nshe got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her\\r\\nbeautiful hair cut off; but that didn\\'t make no change in her\\r\\nyoung man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Holmes, \"I think that what you have been good enough\\r\\nto tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce\\r\\nall that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this\\r\\nsystem of imprisonment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of\\r\\nthe disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was it, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should\\r\\nbe, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain\\r\\narguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your\\r\\ninterests were the same as his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Toller serenely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no\\r\\nwant of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment\\r\\nwhen your master had gone out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have it, sir, just as it happened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\" said Holmes, \"for\\r\\nyou have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And\\r\\nhere comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,\\r\\nWatson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,\\r\\nas it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a\\r\\nquestionable one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the\\r\\ncopper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but\\r\\nwas always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of\\r\\nhis devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who\\r\\nprobably know so much of Rucastle\\'s past life that he finds it\\r\\ndifficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were\\r\\nmarried, by special license, in Southampton the day after their\\r\\nflight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in\\r\\nthe island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend\\r\\nHolmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further\\r\\ninterest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one\\r\\nof his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at\\r\\nWalsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by \\r\\nArthur Conan Doyle\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 1661-8.txt or 1661-8.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/6/1661/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by an anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteer and Jose Menendez\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"

       " u'My own complete happiness, and the\\r\\nhome-centred interests which rise up around the man who first\\r\\nfinds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to\\r\\nabsorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\\r\\nsociety with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in\\r\\nBaker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from\\r\\nweek to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the\\r\\ndrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.',\n",
       " u'He was still,\\r\\nas ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his\\r\\nimmense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\\r\\nfollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which\\r\\nhad been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.',\n",
       " u'From time\\r\\nto time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons\\r\\nto Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\r\\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,\\r\\nand finally of the mission which he had accomplished so\\r\\ndelicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.',\n",
       " u'Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely\\r\\nshared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of\\r\\nmy former friend and companion.',\n",
       " u'One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was\\r\\nreturning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to\\r\\ncivil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street.',\n",
       " u'As I\\r\\npassed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated\\r\\nin my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the\\r\\nStudy in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes\\r\\nagain, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.',\n",
       " u'His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw\\r\\nhis tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against\\r\\nthe blind.',\n",

       " u'To me, who\\r\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their\\r\\nown story.',\n",
       " u'He was at work again.',\n",
       " u'He had risen out of his\\r\\ndrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new\\r\\nproblem.',\n",
       " u'I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which\\r\\nhad formerly been in part my own.',\n",
       " u'His manner was not effusive.',\n",

       " u'With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly\\r\\neye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,\\r\\nand indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.',\n",
       " u'Then he\\r\\nstood before the fire and looked me over in his singular\\r\\nintrospective fashion.',\n",

       " u'Obviously they\\r\\nhave been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round\\r\\nthe edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.',\n",
       " u'Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile\\r\\nweather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting\\r\\nspecimen of the London slavey.',\n",
       " u'As to your practice, if a\\r\\ngentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black\\r\\nmark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge\\r\\non the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted\\r\\nhis stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce\\r\\nhim to be an active member of the medical profession.\"',\n",
       " u'I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\r\\nprocess of deduction.',\n",
       " u'\"When I hear you give your reasons,\" I\\r\\nremarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously\\r\\nsimple that I could easily do it myself, though at each\\r\\nsuccessive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you\\r\\nexplain your process.',\n",
       " u'And yet I believe that my eyes are as good\\r\\nas yours.\"',\n",
       " u'\"Quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing\\r\\nhimself down into an armchair.',\n",
       " u'\"You see, but you do not observe.',\n",

       " u'By-the-way, since you are\\r\\ninterested in these little problems, and since you are good\\r\\nenough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you\\r\\nmay be interested in this.\"',\n",
       " u'He threw over a sheet of thick,\\r\\npink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.',\n",
       " u'\"It came by the last post,\" said he.',\n",

       " u'What do you deduce from it?\"',\n",
       " u'I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\r\\nwritten.',\n",

       " u'Hold it up to the light.\"',\n",
       " u'I did so, and saw a large \"E\" with a small \"g,\" a \"P,\" and a\\r\\nlarge \"G\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.',\n",

       " u'Boots which extended\\r\\nhalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with\\r\\nrich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence\\r\\nwhich was suggested by his whole appearance.',\n",
       " u'He carried a\\r\\nbroad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\r\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black\\r\\nvizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,\\r\\nfor his hand was still raised to it as he entered.',\n",
       " u'From the lower\\r\\npart of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,\\r\\nwith a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive\\r\\nof resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.',\n",

       " u'There are three types of finished intelligence: basic, current, and\\r\\nestimative.',\n",
       " u'Basic intelligence is the fundamental and factual\\r\\nreference material on a country or issue, current intelligence reports\\r\\non new developments, and estimative intelligence judges probable\\r\\noutcomes.',\n",
       " u'The three are mutually supporting because basic intelligence\\r\\nis the foundation on which the other two are based, current\\r\\nintelligence helps to continually update the knowledge foundation, and\\r\\nestimative intelligence serves to revise overall interpretations of\\r\\ncountry and issue prospects for both basic and current intelligence.',\n",

       " u'During World War II intelligence consumers realized that the\\r\\nproduction of basic intelligence by different components of the US\\r\\nGovernment resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting\\r\\ninformation.',\n",
       " u'The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home\\r\\nto Congressional and executive branch leaders the need for integrating\\r\\nand coordinating departmental reports to national policymakers.',\n",
       " u'Detailed general information was needed not only on such major powers\\r\\nas Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest.',\n",
       " u'In the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to\\r\\nlaunch amphibious operations against many islands about which\\r\\ninformation was unconfirmed or nonexistent.',\n",
       " u'Intelligence authorities\\r\\nresolved that the United States should never again be caught\\r\\nunprepared.',\n",

       " u'Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of\\r\\nNaval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of\\r\\nthe Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort\\r\\nshould be initiated.',\n",
       " u'A steering committee was appointed on 27 April\\r\\n1943 that recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study\\r\\nPublishing Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint\\r\\nArmy Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS).',\n",
       " u'JANIS was the first\\r\\ninterdepartmental basic intelligence program and fulfilled the needs\\r\\nof the US Government for an authoritative and coordinated digest of\\r\\nstrategic basic intelligence.',\n",
       " u'Between April 1943 and July 1947, the\\r\\nboard published 34 JANIS studies.',\n",
       " u'JANIS performed well in the war\\r\\neffort, and numerous letters of commendation were received including a\\r\\nstatement from Adm. Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean\\r\\nAreas, which said \"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work\\r\\nfor the shore-based planners.\"',\n",
       " u'The need for even more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar\\r\\nworld was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author\\r\\non national security, when he wrote in The Future of American Secret\\r\\nIntelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world\\r\\nleadership in peace requires more elaborate intelligence than war.',\n",
       " u'\"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities-not\\r\\njust the enemy and his war production.\"',\n",
       " u'The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and\\r\\nofficially began operating 18 September 1947.',\n",
       " u'Effective 1 October\\r\\n1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational\\r\\nresponsibility for JANIS.',\n",

       " u'XXVII., No.',\n",
       " u'2\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary, 1922\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOREWORD\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very curious that much of the history of the United States in the\\r\\nForties and Fifties of the last century has vanished from the general\\r\\nmemory.',\n",
       " u'When a skilled historian reopens the study of Webster\\'s \"Seventh\\r\\nof March speech\" it is more than likely that nine out of ten Americans\\r\\nwill have to cudgel their wits endeavoring to make quite sure just where\\r\\namong our political adventures that famous oration fits in.',\n",
       " u\"How many\\r\\nof us could pass a satisfactory examination on the antecedent train of\\r\\nevents--the introduction in Congress of that Wilmot Proviso designed to\\r\\nmake free soil of all the territory to be acquired in the Mexican War;\\r\\nthe instant and bitter reaction of the South; the various demands for\\r\\nsome sort of partition of the conquered area between the sections,\\r\\nbetween slave labor and free labor; the unforeseen intrusion of the gold\\r\\nseekers of California in 1849, and their unauthorized formation of a new\\r\\nstate based on free labor; the flaming up of Southern alarm, due not to\\r\\none cause but to many, chiefly to the obvious fact that the free states\\r\\nwere acquiring preponderance in Congress; the southern threats of\\r\\nsecession; the fury of the Abolitionists demanding no concessions to the\\r\\nSouth, come what might; and then, just when a rupture seemed inevitable,\\r\\nwhen Northern extremists and Southern extremists seemed about to snatch\\r\\ncontrol of their sections, Webster's bold play to the moderates on both\\r\\nsides, his scheme of compromise, announced in that famous speech on the\\r\\nseventh of March, 1850?\",\n",
       " u'Most people are still aware that Webster was harshly criticized for\\r\\nmaking that speech.',\n",
       " u'It is dimly remembered that the Abolitionists\\r\\ncalled him \"Traitor\", refusing to attribute to him any motive except the\\r\\ngaining of Southern support which might land him in the Presidency.',\n",
       " u'At the time--so bitter was factional suspicion!--this view gained many\\r\\nadherents.',\n",
       " u'It has not lost them all, even now.',\n",
       " u'This false interpretation of Webster turns on two questions--was there\\r\\na real danger of secession in 1850?',\n",
       " u'Was Webster sincere in deriving his\\r\\npolicy from a sense of national peril, not from self-interest?',\n",
       " u'In the\\r\\nstudy which follows Professor Foster makes an adequate case for Webster,\\r\\nanswering the latter question.',\n",
       " u'The former he deals with in a general way\\r\\nestablishing two things, the fact of Southern readiness to secede, the\\r\\nattendant fact that the South changed its attitude after the Seventh\\r\\nof March.',\n",
       " u'His limits prevent his going on to weigh and appraise the\\r\\nsincerity of those fanatics who so furiously maligned Webster, who\\r\\ncreated the tradition that he had cynically sold out to the Southerners.',\n",
       " u'Did they believe their own fiction?',\n",
       " u'The question is a large one and\\r\\ninvolves this other, did they know what was going on in the South?',\n",
       " u'Did\\r\\nthey realize that the Union on March 6, 1850, was actually at a parting\\r\\nof the ways,--that destruction or Civil War formed an imminent issue?',\n",
       " u'Many of those who condemned compromise may be absolved from the charge\\r\\nof insincerity on the ground that they did not care whether the Union\\r\\nwas preserved or riot.',\n",
       " u'Your true blue Abolitionist was very little of\\r\\na materialist.',\n",
       " u'Nor did he have primarily a crusading interest in\\r\\nthe condition of the blacks.',\n",
       " u'He was introspective.',\n",
       " u'He wanted the\\r\\nresponsibility for slavery taken off his own soul.',\n",
       " u'As later events were\\r\\nto prove, he was also pretty nearly a pacifist; war for the Union, pure\\r\\nand simple, made no appeal to him.',\n",
       " u\"It was part of Webster's insight that\\r\\nhe divined this, that he saw there was more pacifism than natural ardor\\r\\nin the North of 1850, saw that the precipitation of a war issue might\\r\\nspell the end of the United Republic.\",\n",
       " u'Therefore, it was to circumvent\\r\\nthe Northern pacifists quite as much as to undermine the Southern\\r\\nexpansionists that he offered compromise and avoided war.',\n",
       " u'But what of those other detractors of Webster, those who were for the\\r\\nUnion and yet believed he had sold out?',\n",
       " u'Their one slim defense is the\\r\\nconviction that the South did not mean what it said, that Webster, had\\r\\nhe dared offend the South, could have saved the day--from their point of\\r\\nview--without making concessions.',\n",
       " u'Professor Foster, always ready to do\\r\\nscrupulous justice, points out the dense ignorance in each section of\\r\\nthe other, and there lets the matter rest.',\n",
       " u'But what shall we say of a\\r\\nframe of mind, which in that moment of crisis, either did not read the\\r\\nSouthern newspapers, or reading them and finding that the whole South\\r\\nwas netted over by a systematically organized secession propaganda made\\r\\nno attempt to gauge its strength, scoffed at it all as buncombe!',\n",
       " u'Even\\r\\nlater historians have done the same thing.',\n",
       " u'In too many cases they have\\r\\nassumed that because the compromise was followed by an apparent collapse\\r\\nof the secession propaganda, the propaganda all along was without\\r\\nreality.',\n",
       " u'We know today that the propaganda did not collapse.',\n",
       " u'For\\r\\nstrategic reasons it changed its policy.',\n",
       " u'But it went on steadily growing\\r\\nand gaining ground until it triumphed in 1861.',\n",
       " u'Webster, not his foolish\\r\\nopponents, gauged its strength correctly in 1850.',\n",
       " u'The clew to what actually happened in 1850 lies in the course of such an\\r\\nardent Southerner as, for example, Langdon Cheeves.',\n",
       " u'Early in the year,\\r\\nhe was a leading secessionist, but at the close of the year a leading\\r\\nanti-secessionist.',\n",
       " u'His change of front, forced upon him by his own\\r\\nthinking about the situation was a bitter disappointment to himself.',\n",
       " u'What animated him was a deep desire to take the whole South out of the\\r\\nUnion.',\n",
       " u'When, at the opening of the year, the North seemed unwilling to\\r\\ncompromise, he, and many another, thought their time had come.',\n",
       " u'At the\\r\\nfirst Nashville Convention he advised a general secession, assuming that\\r\\nVirginia, \"our premier state,\" would lead the movement and when Virginia\\r\\nlater in the year swung over from secession to anti-secession, Cheeves\\r\\nreluctantly changed his policy.',\n",
       " u'The compromise had not altered his\\r\\nviews--broadly speaking it had not satisfied the Lower South--but it had\\r\\ndone something still more eventful, it had so affected the Upper South\\r\\nthat a united secession became for a while impossible.',\n",
       " u'Therefore,\\r\\nCheeves and all like him--and they were the determining factor of the\\r\\nhour--resolved to bide their time, to wait until their propaganda had\\r\\ndone its work, until the entire South should agree to go out together.',\n",
       " u'Their argument, all preserved in print, but ignored by historians for\\r\\nsixty years thereafter, was perfectly frank.',\n",
       " u'As one of them put it, in\\r\\nthe face of the changed attitude of Virginia, \"to secede now would be to\\r\\nsecede from the South.\"',\n",
       " u\"Here is the aspect of Webster's great stroke that was so long ignored.\",\n",
       " u'He did not satisfy the whole South.',\n",
       " u'He did not make friends for himself\\r\\nof Southerners generally.',\n",
       " u'What he did do was to drive a wedge into the\\r\\nSouth, to divide it temporarily against itself.',\n",
       " u'He arrayed the Upper\\r\\nSouth against the Lower and thus because of the ultimate purposes of men\\r\\nlike Cheeves, with their ambition to weld the South into a genuine unit,\\r\\nhe forced them all to stand still, and thus to give Northern pacifism a\\r\\nchance to ebb, Northern nationalism a chance to develop.',\n",
       " u\"A comprehensive\\r\\nbrief for the defense on this crucial point in the interpretation of\\r\\nAmerican history, is Professor Foster's contribution.\",\n",
       " u'NATHANIEL WRIGHT STEPHENSON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWEBSTER\\'S SEVENTH OF MARCH SPEECH AND THE SECESSION MOVEMENT, 1850\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moral earnestness and literary skill of Whittier, Lowell, Garrison,\\r\\nPhillips, and Parker, have fixed in many minds the antislavery doctrine\\r\\nthat Webster\\'s 7th of March speech was \"scandalous, treachery\", and\\r\\nWebster a man of little or no \"moral sense\", courage, or statesmanship.',\n",
       " u'That bitter atmosphere, reproduced by Parton and von Holst, was\\r\\nperpetuated a generation later by Lodge.',\n",
       " u'[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1900, over fifty publications throwing light on Webster and the\\r\\nSecession movement of 1850 have appeared, nearly a score\\r\\ncontaining fresh contemporary evidence.',\n",

       " u'Under the auspices of the American Historical Association have appeared\\r\\nthe correspondence of Calhoun, of Chase, of Toombs, Stephens, and\\r\\nCobb, and of Hunter of Virginia.',\n",
       " u'Van Tyne\\'s Letters of Webster (1902),\\r\\nincluding hundreds hitherto unpublished, was further supplemented in\\r\\nthe sixteenth volume of the \"National Edition\" of Webster\\'s Writings and\\r\\nSpeeches (1903).',\n",
       " u'These two editions contain, for 1850 alone, 57 inedited\\r\\nletters.',\n",
       " u'Manuscript collections and newspapers, comparatively unknown to earlier\\r\\nwriters, have been utilized in monographs dealing with the situation in\\r\\n1850 in South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina,\\r\\nLouisiana, and Tennessee, published by.',\n",

       " u\"The new printed evidence\\r\\nis confirmed by manuscript material: 2,500 letters of the Greenough\\r\\nCollection available since the publication of the recent editions of\\r\\nWebster's letters and apparently unused by Webster's biographers;\\r\\nand Hundreds of still inedited Webster Papers in the New Hampshire\\r\\nHistorical Society, and scattered in minor collections.\",\n",
       " u\"[2] This mass\\r\\nof new material makes possible and desirable a re-examination of the\\r\\nevidence as to (1) the danger from the secession movement in 1850; (2)\\r\\nWebster's change in attitude toward the disunion danger in February,\\r\\n1850; (3) the purpose and character of his 7th of March speech; (4) the\\r\\neffects of his speech and attitude upon the secession movement.\",\n",
       " u'I.',\n",
       " u\"During the session of Congress of 1849-1850, the peace of the Union\\r\\nwas threatened by problems centering around slavery and the territory\\r\\nacquired as a result of the Mexican War: California's demand for\\r\\nadmission with a constitution prohibiting slavery; the Wilmot Proviso\\r\\nexcluding slavery from the rest of the Mexican acquisitions (Utah and\\r\\nNew Mexico); the boundary dispute between Texas and New Mexico; the\\r\\nabolition of slave trade in the District of Columbia; and an effective\\r\\nfugitive slave law to replace that of 1793.\",\n",
       " u'The evidence for the steadily growing danger of secession until March,\\r\\n1850, is no longer to be sought in Congressional speeches, but rather\\r\\nin the private letters of those men, Northern and Southern, who were the\\r\\nshrewdest political advisers of the South, and in the official acts of\\r\\nrepresentative bodies of Southerners in local or state meetings, state\\r\\nlegislatures, and the Nashville Convention.',\n",
       " u'Even after the compromise\\r\\nwas accepted in the South and the secessionists defeated in 1850-1851,\\r\\nthe Southern states generally adopted the Georgia platform or its\\r\\nequivalent declaring that the Wilmot Proviso or the repeal of the\\r\\nfugitive-slave law would lead the South to \"resist even (as a last\\r\\nresort) to a disruption of every tie which binds her to the Union\".',\n",
       " u'Southern disunion sentiment was not sporadic or a party matter; it was\\r\\nendemic.',\n",
       " u'The disunion sentiment in the North was not general; but Garrison,\\r\\npublicly proclaiming \"I am an abolitionist and therefore for the\\r\\ndissolution of the Union\", and his followers who pronounced \"the\\r\\nConstitution a covenant with death and an agreement with hell\",\\r\\nexercised a twofold effect far in excess of their numbers.',\n",
       " u'In the North,\\r\\nabolitionists aroused bitter antagonism to slavery; in the South\\r\\nthey strengthened the conviction of the lawfulness of slavery and the\\r\\ndesirability of secession in preference to abolition.',\n",
       " u'\"The abolition\\r\\nquestion must soon divide us\", a South Carolinian wrote his former\\r\\nprincipal in Vermont.',\n",
       " u'\"We are beginning to look upon it [disunion] as\\r\\na relief from incessant insult.',\n",
       " u'I have been myself surprised at the\\r\\nunusual prevalence and depth of this feeling.\"',\n",
       " u'[3] \"The abolition\\r\\nmovement\", as Houston has pointed out, \"prevented any considerable\\r\\nabatement of feeling, and added volume to the current which was to\\r\\nsweep the State out of the Union in 1860.\"',\n",
       " u'[4] South Carolina\\'s ex-governor,\\r\\nHammond, wrote Calhoun in December, 1849, \"the conduct of the\\r\\nabolitionists in congress is daily giving it [disunion] powerful aid\".',\n",
       " u'\"The sooner we can get rid of it [the union] the better.\"',\n",
       " u'[5] The\\r\\nconclusion of both Blair of Kentucky and Winthrop [6] of Massachusetts,\\r\\nthat \"Calhoun and his instruments are really solicitous to break up the\\r\\nUnion\", was warranted by Calhoun\\'s own statement.',\n",
       " u'Calhoun, desiring to save the Union if he could, but at all events to\\r\\nsave the South, and convinced that there was \"no time to lose\", hoped\\r\\n\"a decisive issue will be made with the North\".',\n",
       " u'In February, 1850, he\\r\\nwrote, \"Disunion is the only alternative that is left us.\"',\n",
       " u'[7] At last\\r\\nsupported by some sort of action in thirteen Southern states, and in\\r\\nnine states by appointment of delegates to his Southern Convention,\\r\\nhe declared in the Senate, March 4, \"the South, is united against the\\r\\nWilmot proviso, and has committed itself, by solemn resolutions, to\\r\\nresist should it be adopted\".',\n",
