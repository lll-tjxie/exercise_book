       " u\"She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\\nindulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,\\nbeen mistress of his house from a very early period.\",\n",
       " u'Her mother\\nhad died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct\\nremembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied\\nby an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short\\nof a mother in affection.',\n",
       " u\"Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family,\\nless as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,\\nbut particularly of Emma.\",\n",
       " u'Between _them_ it was more the intimacy\\nof sisters.',\n",
       " u\"Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal\\noffice of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\\nher to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being\\nnow long passed away, they had been living together as friend and\\nfriend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;\\nhighly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by\\nher own.\",\n",
       " u\"The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little\\ntoo well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened\\nalloy to her many enjoyments.\",\n",
       " u'The danger, however, was at present\\nso unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\\nwith her.',\n",
       " u'Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.',\n",
       " u\"It was Miss\\nTaylor's loss which first brought grief.\",\n",
       " u'It was on the wedding-day\\nof this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought\\nof any continuance.',\n",
       " u'The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,\\nher father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect\\nof a third to cheer a long evening.',\n",
       " u'Her father composed himself\\nto sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit\\nand think of what she had lost.',\n",
       " u'The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.',\n",
       " u\"Mr. Weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,\\nand pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished\\nand promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.\",\n",
       " u'The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.',\n",
       " u'She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\\nyears--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\\nyears old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\\nher in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses\\nof childhood.',\n",
       " u\"A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\\nintercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\\nunreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their\\nbeing left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.\",\n",
       " u'She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\\nwell-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\\ninterested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\\nin every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\\nevery thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her\\nas could never find fault.',\n",
       " u'How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was\\ngoing only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must\\nbe the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,\\nand a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,\\nnatural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering\\nfrom intellectual solitude.',\n",
       " u'She dearly loved her father, but he\\nwas no companion for her.',\n",
       " u'He could not meet her in conversation,\\nrational or playful.',\n",
       " u'The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\\nof mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;\\nand though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\\nand his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him\\nat any time.',\n",
       " u'Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,\\nbeing settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond\\nher daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must\\nbe struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next\\nvisit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,\\nto fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.',\n",
       " u'Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,\\nand name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.',\n",
       " u'The Woodhouses\\nwere first in consequence there.',\n",
       " u'All looked up to them.',\n",
       " u'She had\\nmany acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,\\nbut not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss\\nTaylor for even half a day.',\n",
       " u'It was a melancholy change; and Emma\\ncould not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,\\ntill her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.',\n",
       " u'His spirits required support.',\n",
       " u'He was a nervous man, easily depressed;\\nfond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;\\nhating change of every kind.',\n",
       " u\"Matrimony, as the origin of change,\\nwas always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled\\nto his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but\\nwith compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from\\nhis habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to\\nsuppose that other people could feel differently from himself,\\nhe was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad\\na thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal\\nhappier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.\",\n",
       " u'Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him\\nfrom such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him\\nnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\\n\\n\"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.',\n",
       " u'What a pity it\\nis that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!\"',\n",
       " u'\"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.',\n",
       " u'Mr. Weston is such\\na good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\\na good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us\\nfor ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?\"',\n",
       " u'\"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?',\n",
       " u'This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,\\nmy dear.\"',\n",
       " u'\"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see\\nus!--We shall be always meeting!',\n",
       " u'_We_ must begin; we must go and pay\\nwedding visit very soon.\"',\n",
       " u'\"My dear, how am I to get so far?',\n",
       " u'Randalls is such a distance.',\n",
       " u'I could not walk half so far.\"',\n",
       " u'\"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.',\n",
       " u'We must go in the carriage,\\nto be sure.\"',\n",
       " u'\"The carriage!',\n",
       " u'But James will not like to put the horses to for\\nsuch a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we\\nare paying our visit?\"',\n",
       " u'\"They are to be put into Mr. Weston\\'s stable, papa.',\n",
       " u'You know we\\nhave settled all that already.',\n",
       " u'We talked it all over with Mr. Weston\\nlast night.',\n",
       " u\"And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like\\ngoing to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.\",\n",
       " u'I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.',\n",
       " u'That was\\nyour doing, papa.',\n",
       " u'You got Hannah that good place.',\n",
       " u'Nobody thought\\nof Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\"',\n",
       " u'\"I am very glad I did think of her.',\n",
       " u'It was very lucky, for I would\\nnot have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;\\nand I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,\\npretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.',\n",
       " u'Whenever I see her,\\nshe always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;\\nand when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she\\nalways turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.',\n",
       " u'I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great\\ncomfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is\\nused to see.',\n",
       " u'Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know,\\nshe will be hearing of us.',\n",
       " u'He will be able to tell her how we\\nall are.\"',\n",
       " u'Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,\\nand hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.',\n",
       " u'The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.',\n",
       " u\"Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.\",\n",
       " u'He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,\\nand always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,\\nas coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.',\n",
       " u\"He had\\nreturned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked\\nup to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.\",\n",
       " u'It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.',\n",
       " u'Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;\\nand his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and her children were\\nanswered most satisfactorily.',\n",
       " u'When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse\\ngratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come\\nout at this late hour to call upon us.',\n",
       " u'I am afraid you must have\\nhad a shocking walk.\"',\n",
       " u'\"Not at all, sir.',\n",
       " u'It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild\\nthat I must draw back from your great fire.\"',\n",
       " u'\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.',\n",
       " u'I wish you may\\nnot catch cold.\"',\n",
       " u'\"Dirty, sir!',\n",
       " u'Look at my shoes.',\n",
       " u'Not a speck on them.\"',\n",
       " u'\"Well!',\n",
       " u'that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal\\nof rain here.',\n",
       " u'It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour\\nwhile we were at breakfast.',\n",
       " u'I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"',\n",
       " u'\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.',\n",
       " u'Being pretty well aware\\nof what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry\\nwith my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.',\n",
       " u'How did you all behave?',\n",
       " u'Who cried most?\"',\n",
       " u'\"Ah!',\n",
       " u'poor Miss Taylor!',\n",
       " u'\\'Tis a sad business.\"',\n",
       " u'\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly\\nsay `poor Miss Taylor.\\'',\n",
       " u'I have a great regard for you and Emma;\\nbut when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At\\nany rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.\"',\n",
       " u'\"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!\"',\n",
       " u'said Emma playfully.',\n",
       " u'\"That is what you have in your head,\\nI know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"',\n",
       " u'\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwith a sigh.',\n",
       " u'\"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"',\n",
       " u'\"My dearest papa!',\n",
       " u'You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose\\nMr. Knightley to mean _you_.',\n",
       " u'What a horrible idea!',\n",
       " u'Oh no!',\n",
       " u'I meant\\nonly myself.',\n",

       " u'We always say what we like to one another.\"',\n",
       " u'Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see\\nfaults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:\\nand though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself,\\nshe knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would\\nnot have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being\\nthought perfect by every body.',\n",
       " u'\"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I\\nmeant no reflection on any body.',\n",
       " u'Miss Taylor has been used\\nto have two persons to please; she will now have but one.',\n",
       " u'The chances are that she must be a gainer.\"',\n",
       " u'\"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass--\"you want to hear\\nabout the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all\\nbehaved charmingly.',\n",
       " u'Every body was punctual, every body in their\\nbest looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.',\n",
       " u'Oh no;\\nwe all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart,\\nand were sure of meeting every day.\"',\n",
       " u'\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father.',\n",
       " u'\"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,\\nand I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\"',\n",

       " u'\"We should not like her so well as we do, sir,\\nif we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to\\nMiss Taylor\\'s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be,\\nat Miss Taylor\\'s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own,\\nand how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision,\\nand therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.',\n",
       " u'Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily\\nmarried.\"',\n",
       " u'\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma,\\n\"and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.',\n",
       " u'I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place,\\nand be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would\\nnever marry again, may comfort me for any thing.\"',\n",

       " u'Oh dear, no!',\n",
       " u'Mr. Weston, who had been a widower\\nso long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife,\\nso constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his\\nfriends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--\\nMr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did\\nnot like it.',\n",
       " u'Oh no!',\n",
       " u'Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.',\n",
       " u'Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed,\\nand others of the son and the uncle not letting him.',\n",
       " u'All manner\\nof solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none\\nof it.',\n",
       " u'\"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I\\nmet with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,\\nhe darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas\\nfor us from Farmer Mitchell\\'s, I made up my mind on the subject.',\n",
       " u'I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed\\nme in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave\\noff match-making.\"',\n",

       " u\"A worthy employment for a young\\nlady's mind!\",\n",
       " u\"But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match,\\nas you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself\\none idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor\\nif Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself\\nevery now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success?\",\n",
       " u'Where\\nis your merit?',\n",

       " u'Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances\\nof his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,\\nof a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love\\nwith him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,\\nwho had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,\\nwhich the connexion would offend.',\n",
       " u'Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command\\nof her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the\\nfamily-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it\\ntook place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,\\nwho threw her off with due decorum.',\n",
       " u'It was an unsuitable connexion,\\nand did not produce much happiness.',\n",
       " u'Mrs. Weston ought to have found\\nmore in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper\\nmade him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness\\nof being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,\\nshe had not the best.',\n",
       " u\"She had resolution enough to pursue\\nher own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain\\nfrom unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,\\nnor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\",\n",
       " u'They lived beyond\\ntheir income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:\\nshe did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once\\nto be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.',\n",
       " u\"Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst\\nof the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage,\\nhe was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\",\n",
       " u'From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.',\n",
       " u\"The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering\\nillness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;\\nand Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,\\nnor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to\\ntake the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.\",\n",
       " u'Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed\\nto have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,\\nthe child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,\\nand he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to\\nimprove as he could.',\n",
       " u'A complete change of life became desirable.',\n",
       " u'He quitted the militia\\nand engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a\\ngood way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.',\n",
       " u'It was a concern which brought just employment enough.',\n",
       " u'He had still\\na small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;\\nand between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,\\nthe next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.',\n",
       " u'He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure\\nthe purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had\\nalways longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even\\nas Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own\\nfriendly and social disposition.',\n",
       " u'It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence\\nhis schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth\\non youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling\\ntill he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long\\nlooked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects\\nin view, till they were accomplished.',\n",
       " u'He had made his fortune,\\nbought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new\\nperiod of existence, with every probability of greater happiness\\nthan in any yet passed through.',\n",
       " u'He had never been an unhappy man;\\nhis own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;\\nbut his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly\\namiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof\\nof its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,\\nto excite gratitude than to feel it.',\n",
       " u\"He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was\\nhis own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought\\nup as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption\\nas to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.\",\n",
       " u\"It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his\\nfather's assistance.\",\n",
       " u'His father had no apprehension of it.',\n",
       " u\"The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;\\nbut it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice\\ncould be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,\\nso deservedly dear.\",\n",
       " u'He saw his son every year in London,\\nand was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\\nyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.',\n",
       " u'He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his\\nmerits and prospects a kind of common concern.',\n",
       " u'Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life.',\n",
       " u'His coming\\nto visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.',\n",
       " u\"Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed,\\nas a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.\",\n",
       " u'There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when\\nMrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and\\nMiss Bates returned the visit.',\n",
       " u'Now was the time for Mr. Frank\\nChurchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was\\nunderstood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.',\n",
       " u'For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention\\nof the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.',\n",
       " u'\"I suppose you\\nhave heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written\\nto Mrs. Weston?',\n",
       " u'I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.',\n",
       " u'Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.',\n",
       " u'Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he\\nsays he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.\"',\n",
       " u'It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.',\n",
       " u'Mrs. Weston had, of course,\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,\\nand a most welcome addition to every source and every expression\\nof congratulation which her marriage had already secured.',\n",
       " u'She felt\\nherself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough\\nto know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only\\nregret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship\\nfor her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.',\n",
       " u\"She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,\\nwithout pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering\\nan hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear\\nEmma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation\\nthan most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,\\nand spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily\\nthrough its little difficulties and privations.\",\n",
       " u\"And then there was\\nsuch comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,\\nso convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's\\ndisposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching\\nseason no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the\\nweek together.\",\n",
       " u\"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude\\nto Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her\\nsatisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment,\\nwas so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,\\nwas sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity\\n`poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre\\nof every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening\\nattended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.\",\n",
       " u'But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse\\'s giving a gentle sigh,\\nand saying, \"Ah, poor Miss Taylor!',\n",
       " u'She would be very glad to stay.\"',\n",
       " u'There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of\\nceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation\\nto Mr. Woodhouse.',\n",
       " u'The compliments of his neighbours were over;\\nhe was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event;\\nand the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,\\nwas all eat up.',\n",
       " u'His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he\\ncould never believe other people to be different from himself.',\n",
       " u\"What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;\\nand he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having\\nany wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly\\ntried to prevent any body's eating it.\",\n",
       " u'He had been at the pains\\nof consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.',\n",
       " u\"Mr. Perry\\nwas an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\\nof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,\\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the\\nbias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree\\nwith many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.\",\n",
       " u'With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped\\nto influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the\\ncake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till\\nit was all gone.',\n",
       " u\"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys\\nbeing seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their\\nhands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.\",\n",
       " u'CHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.',\n",
       " u'He liked very much\\nto have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,\\nfrom his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,\\nfrom his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the\\nvisits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.',\n",
       " u'He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;\\nhis horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit\\nfor any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.',\n",
       " u'Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,\\nand Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,\\ncomprehended many such.',\n",
       " u\"Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion,\\nhe had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening\\nparties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any\\ntime unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week\\nin which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.\",\n",
       " u\"Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;\\nand by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it,\\nthe privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude\\nfor the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room,\\nand the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being\\nthrown away.\",\n",
       " u'After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able\\nof whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies\\nalmost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield,\\nand who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse\\nthought it no hardship for either James or the horses.',\n",
       " u'Had it\\ntaken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.',\n",
       " u'Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a\\nvery old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.',\n",
       " u'She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was\\nconsidered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady,\\nunder such untoward circumstances, can excite.',\n",
       " u'Her daughter enjoyed\\na most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,\\nhandsome, rich, nor married.',\n",
       " u'Miss Bates stood in the very worst\\npredicament in the world for having much of the public favour;\\nand she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,\\nor frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.',\n",
       " u'She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.',\n",
       " u'Her youth\\nhad passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\\nto the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\\nincome go as far as possible.',\n",
       " u'And yet she was a happy woman,\\nand a woman whom no one named without good-will.',\n",
       " u'It was her own\\nuniversal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.',\n",
       " u\"She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness,\\nquicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate\\ncreature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,\\nand so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted\\nfor nothing.\",\n",
       " u'The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,\\nher contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,\\nand a mine of felicity to herself.',\n",
       " u'She was a great talker upon\\nlittle matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial\\ncommunications and harmless gossip.',\n",
       " u'Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary,\\nor an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\\nupon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for\\nenormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but\\na real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,\\nand where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble\\nthemselves into a little education, without any danger of coming\\nback prodigies.',\n",
       " u\"Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and\\nvery deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy\\nspot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty\\nof wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,\\nand in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.\",\n",
       " u'It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\\nafter her to church.',\n",
       " u\"She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled\\nto the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly\\nowed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim\\non her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work,\\nwhenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.\",\n",
       " u\"These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently\\nable to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake,\\nin the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned,\\nit was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.\",\n",
       " u'She was delighted\\nto see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with\\nherself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings\\nof three such women made her feel that every evening so spent\\nwas indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.',\n",
       " u'As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close\\nof the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting,\\nin most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her;\\na most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen,\\nwhom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in,\\non account of her beauty.',\n",
       " u'A very gracious invitation was returned,\\nand the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.',\n",

       " u'She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\nwhich Emma particularly admired.',\n",
       " u'She was short, plump, and fair,\\nwith a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,\\nand a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,\\nEmma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite\\ndetermined to continue the acquaintance.',\n",
       " u\"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly\\nimpressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style\\nto what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,\\nand deserve encouragement.\",\n",
       " u'Encouragement should be given.',\n",

       " u'_She_ would notice her; she would improve her;\\nshe would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\\ninto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.',\n",
       " u'It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;\\nhighly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.',\n",
       " u'She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking\\nand listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that\\nthe evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,\\nwhich always closed such parties, and for which she had been\\nused to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,\\nand moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.',\n",
       " u'With an\\nalacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never\\nindifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,\\nwith the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,\\ndid she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend\\nthe minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she\\nknew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.',\n",
       " u'Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.',\n",
       " u'He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion\\nof his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome\\nmade him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his\\nhospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,\\nhis care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.',\n",
